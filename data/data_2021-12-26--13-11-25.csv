I simply cannot budget $80 every month for a product like this, especially during these times.   I found a few other products that might not be as convenient, because I have to buy 2-3 different items to get everything that AG1 has, but even so, adding all of those together comes out to less than $40/mn, which is half what AG1 charges, and it tastes better.

And the shipping of AG has blown me away, as I've never had ANYTHING ship so quickly and timely before! Not sure how you do it, but it needs to be recognized!

I put a scoop in 8-10 ounces of cold water and drink it down as quickly as possible. I was hoping it would be more of a sipping through the day kind of drink but definitely not. 2. The taste although not awful, isn't awesome. I can really taste the stevia and I'm not a fan of that. It makes it rather unpleasant. 3. The benefits - I like to think it is making me healthier. I try to be as healthy as possible without overdoing things, I do enjoy living life, I'm very active, busy and don't love to spend lots of time cooking, so I'm hoping this is helping. I haven't noticed anything like more energy, better recovery, etc. I am hoping with more use I will see these results and if not, I am just hoping that it is helping my body in some way. 4. The price - wow, as a Canadian, this is a huge cost for me and without seeing much benefit and not enjoying the taste or experience of drinking it, I'm not sure how long I can sustain these monthly payments.

Sure, it is an acquired tasting green juice that provides a degree of daily nutrient insurance.

You may or may not feel any difference, but you will have daily peace of mind that you started the day off with a healthy habit. For those who can afford it, that can be worth the monthly purchase.

I don't know what more I can say about Athletic Greens, but give it a shot and hopefully it will impact you in as much a positive way as it has for me.

The only drawback is the taste. Unpleasant. But there are ways to get around that:  1. Use only 8 ounces of water, the minimum recommended amount.  2. Make the water as cold as possible - ice water, or at least refrigerated in advance. The colder the water, the less you taste the potion.  3. Have a second beverage to cleanse your taste buds ready to go for right after you drink it.  4. Chug the 8 ounces, and stop drinking as soon as you hit the foam; that's the worst-tasting part.  5. As soon as you have downed it all, grab that taste bud cleanser and take a swig of it. For me, black coffee does the trick.  Bottom line: a superior supplement formula, that actually makes a difference in your energy level. Just be ready to cope with the taste.

It's also nice to have both pre- and probiotics in one easy shaker bottle. The value and convenience are worth it; I just 'budget' accordingly.   As far as the taste, I have to say it tastes good to me. I use 12 oz of water when I mix my drink. Initially I used 8 oz and it seemed too strong.   Other than that, I wholeheartedly endorse this product for its authenticity as a whole food vitamin source. Unless they change their formula, I plan on continuing to purchase AG.

I have had no wild/crazy results on it, but with vitamins/foods, trusting that the product is as advertised, I would guess ""no news is good news"" applies!  I would have not tried the product if it were not for a shipping discount on the first order. I believe shipping is running about $8-$9. Unfortunately, with USPS, this high cost of shipping does not translate into quick service - I ran out of product on Day 31, and should have received the second shipment, however, no AG today due to still awaiting the product. I am wondering if another shipping method could finish off the quality product and service with a more timely receipt of the next month's order (this may help to justify the costly shipping.) It would be good if AG would throw in at least another day or two supply in the bag for the month in case shipping is delayed.

That said I question whether the dosages are of any clinical effectiveness as there is very little transparency in the amounts of the ingredients contained in each complex. For exa...Read MoreRead more about review stating Dosage Effectivenessmple the ""Digestive Enzyme and Super Mushroom Complex"" list the quantity for the total amount of ingredients but doesn't include specifics per ingredient. The total amount of ingredients for the complex is 154mg but depending on the study, the clinically effective dose of reishi is 6 to 12 g extract daily. Ganopoly (a Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide extract) in doses up to 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks has been used in a few clinical trials.* The entire complex is no where near that dose and reishi specifically is the second to last ingredient listed so I can only assume there is barely a fraction of the effective dose. This leaves one to wonder how Athletic Greens determined the quantity of each ingredient to include, and was it based on any science regarding clinical effectiveness, or is it all marketing to just be able to say they include these really powerful ingredients regardless of effectiveness? I like to think I'm benefitting from Athletic Greens, but considering that I don't really feel any different when I take it, do I just need to double my dose, or considering the miniscule amounts of some of the ingredients would it not even matter and have I been sold on marketing hype alone? I'd love to see more transparency in the quantities of each ingredient as well as support for the dosages they included, otherwise for the nutrients they do quantify, I can get a comparable multivitamin for fraction of the cost.  *https://www.drugs.com/npp/reishi-mushroom.html Read LessRead less about review stating Dosage Effectiveness"

William T.,5.0 star rating,03/28/21, Great Product ," I have been an Athletic Greens customer since the middle of 2020, and I have found it to be a great tasting and easy to use product that has taken the place of traditional pill supplements in my diet while proving to be overall better for my diet. At first, I was skeptical of it given my past experiences with green supplements and drinks that tend...Read MoreRead more about review stating Great Product to taste horrible and leave an aftertaste thats worse then eating chalk, but athletic greens is different. It mixes well, tastes great, and the container and scoop that they send you really helps with keeping it fresh in the fridge. I also subscribe and get the vanilla protein powder, which has little sugar but still tastes better then some brands that are loaded with sugar. I tend to mix the green supplement with the protein powder in the morning and I find the combination is a great way to start the day. My only criticism is that the amount that they send in the green packet rarely lasts all month even with careful even spoon fulls and management, and the portion powder only lasts about 18 days, so I have found myself having to order extra canisters of the protein powder and the greens shake to fully make it last a month between subscription shipments. Overall, a great product that I would highly recommend, just be sure to watch how much your using if you want to make it last to the next shipment.

It definitely helps keep you regular and forces you to drink water first thing in the AM which is great.   Some downsides - I've been losing a ton of hair and it only began when I started the supplement about ~30 days ago. It's more than my usual hair loss (coming out in clumps). I looked it up online and it could be because I already have enough Vitamin A, E, Selenium and it can cause hair loss when you ""overdo"" those supplements. Unfortunately, I can't prove it's linked to Athletic greens, and I can't take out those supplements specifically from the mix, and I think the rest of the mix is helping me, so I'm hoping the effects wear off after my body gets used to it Read LessRead less about review stating Overall great, some side effects"

Along with an Intermittent Fast Diet I introduced Athletic Greens into my daily diet. Results for me were nearly immediate. After the first week I noticed a shift in mentality and more regular energy. My mind seemed sharper and more focused. Having the greens first thing in the morning also cut out cravings which was a huge benefit to the diet and within a month I had dropped a significant amount of weight! Since then I had cut my subscription, but I am back again and after only a month noticed results once again.   I find the quality of this product to be top-notch. Not only does it taste much better than any other greens I have tried , but it yields results. On top of this the customer service I have encountered has been exemplary.

Business method is confusingtic, and the texture makes it a little hard to take down, but it's way better than trying to eat vegetables.   For my initial order, I used a coupon code for 5 free singles, and somehow only got 2 in my package. That was a little weird.   Then, after my first order I received a referral link to give out to give people 5 free singles, and told EVERYONE about it, and after I gave out the link I realized that you're REQUIRED to buy a full bag to get those singles. Now, I was willing to lay out the money to try this, but 75-100 is a LOT to expect someone to lay out when trying something new. I thought the whole point of the singles were to get people to see how good the product was, and THEN go buy the monthly supply. That would make more sense, and would probably get you all a lot more orders. I have friends who would be willing to try it for free first, but not lay out the money. But I know if they were able to try it, they would get hooked like I did.   I did have my mom order a full supply with my code, and she didn't get any singles in her order. Separate issue, but also strange.   I love this product, I just wish I were able to share it with more people! Read LessRead less about review stating Product changed my life.

Please forgive the pretentious breakdo...Read MoreRead more about review stating Flavor reminds me of a pineapple coconut Bai waterwn... but again, just for people sensitive to taste or REALLY want to avoid something in particular (looking at you stevia).   - First two notes read as pineapple and coconut to me. Pineapple has always hidden bitterness from greens really well in my experience, which I'm imagining is why they picked it. But really hoping the flavor doesn't quickly get old. - No bitterness from the greens, but there is a slightly sweet w/ detectable amounts of stevia (very subtle). - Has a mildly chalky-nutty aftertaste which increases the longer it sits.  - It also went from 0/10 grittiness to maybe a 2/10 grittiness after sitting for 10ish mins.   Overall - definitely palatable and note detoured by taste alone. I don't imagine that I'll be looking forward to drinking it everyday, but I won't dread it either, and definitely didn't have to chug it to finish it. Will for sure continue to buy if the results are there.    GL everyone! Read LessRead less about review stating Flavor reminds me of a pineapple coconut Bai water"

I was a 2-3 cup a day drinker, and now have no urge to drink a cup for any other reason than flavor.  After a month, I felt better, had longer and more sustained energy, lost some weight, and feel healthier all around.  My wife has also now started on a scoop a day and is seeing similar results.

(at that time, $$ was tight, so I just wasn't committed to spending the high$ anymore, until now!) My son turned me back on to AG after sharing the wonderful results he was experiencing! He learned about it from a podcast. Well, that said enough for me becaus...Read MoreRead more about review stating Exceptional Product and Results!e I know my son, having raised him myself and he has ultimately suffered, what many do everyday, with depression, fatigue, no motivation among other negative feelings and so....wow, this did if for him! He started a new job back in September 2020 during a time the Pandemic was still at a scary place for us all, a front line worker that needed a boost in order to survive this new challenge in his life! It has pushed him to such a better place, that I'm taking this time to share it! As for me, being back on AG for the past month does remind me of the first taste I had encountered way back in 2015. It's probably the best GREENS taste of many brands I have tried to date. Has a bit of a cocoa flavor so it helps to mask the tremendous response you may encounter as you try drinking potent greens nutrition for the first time. Relieved to have come back to this after noticing the remarkable response that my son embraced while taking AG himself. I had made a one-time purchase last month, sparing the $20 savings incase I was not gaining anything positive from using this again, and so now I will subscribe. Being a 50yo woman going through that sh** we all encounter around this age makes it difficult at times to stick to all the good things in life, mainly nutrition! So, just in this last month of downing the AG with10ozs of water every morning upon waking up, has given me the motivation to feel that nutrition is the most important thing any of us can gain for a better quality life, so I will be connecting my soul to AG ongoing and skip all those other supplements I've been taking for the past few years, even my multi-vitamin can take a place back on the store shelf, AG seems to have it all and some! I feel fantastic considering the sh** 50yo women go through during this time, so thank you to Athletic Greens! Read LessRead less about review stating Exceptional Product and Results!"

As many have said in reviews I've read, the taste is an acquired one. It has a flavor that reminds me of bubble gum but an earthy bubble gum. As long as my water is extremely cold, the taste does not bother me. The one thing that keeps Athletic Greens from being excellent is that they don't fully dissolve. No matter how much water I use, how much I shake it up, or how long I let the greens sit and then re-shake them, there's always a fair amount of grit at the bottom. I have to clench my teeth and use them as a strainer and then chew up the grit. Otherwise, it causes me to cough and sometimes gag.

The taste is pretty nice, especially if mixed with tea or a shake.

I still have some packets left, so I will try again in a few weeks during the winter, and will revisit how I feel about this product.

I order a lot of things online and most companies include free shipping when you spend more than 75 dollars (regardless of the weight). To be honest, I am considering looking for other alternatives because of this. I am sure i am probably not the only one who is a bit tight financially, and can share the same feelings.

I'd supplemented with D3 to some help, but everything else I'd tried over some 30 years was essentially worthless and a waste of hard earned money. I began consuming Athletic Greens about 14 months ago and while I do believe I've contracted Viruses during these last 14 months, I have exhibited almost no cold symptoms. Keep in mind that a large portion of this time frame happened during the Pandemic, in New York City (Manhattan), and as an ""Essential Worker"" I spent five days each week walking to and from work, and interacting with a great many people.

That is all that I have actually noticed or attributed directly towards taking the all in one supplement but in my mind it‚Äôs one of those things that you see over a long period of time by giving your body the nutrients it needs everyday to maintain a healthy body.

I feel healthy on the product. I can't point to one specific example of an improvement like others have, it's just more a general sense of well-being on the nutrition front. How much is related to this product vs my generally good diet is hard to tell, but I feel the product is a benefit.  Cons:  1. Expensive. Did I say expensive? I don't like that they charge $8 shipping on top of an already expensive product. Add in tax and it's costing over $90 per bag which I believe is too expensive. I believe they should reduce or eliminate the shipping cost.  2. Absorption. I find this product hard to dissolve completely. I use a shaker and it mostly dissolves but I still find undissolved residue at the bottom. For me it can be hard to swallow the last portion of the bottle and I usually just leave it untouched. It has a fine sand consistency that doesn't go down easily. On the positive side I find the taste of the product decent and at least 90% of it feels like it dissolves and is easy to drink down.  3. Disposable plastic: Every bag comes with a plastic scoop. I think this should be eliminated. First of all it's wasteful, secondly it's not helpful: the handle is short and when the contents get low you end up with a lot of green dust on your hands. It is better to use a reusable long handled measuring spoon. Everyone has or can get one of these for a few dollars. Please echo my call for the company to stop shipping disposable plastic scoops.

Although there hasn't been the opportunity to do any racing, on the training front and blocks I have completed, I've noticed consistent energy levels, less cramping and muscle soreness, so am keen to see if this translates also in a race environment and heavier volume block. The downside of the product is definitely the cost. The fluctuations of AUD vs USD is imrpoving helping on the subscription cost, but its still high, but am looking at it as a investment. Separately, it would be a good value-add if Athletic Greens offered each member a Greens Shaker upon first subscription or perhaps after 3-months of subscription. To ask for members to fork out again for this seems a bit cheeky. That aside, a good product which I'll keep using and have already referred it to many friends.

And it was weird hearing it because it‚Äôs not something you notice it‚Äôs something others notice about you. I got a personal trainer and my work outs are intense. I‚Äôm not an athlete by far. I‚Äôm just a guy trying to recover from a really bad injury. But man is my trainer surprised at how quickly I bounce back.

I went from barely being able to walk 10 minutes at 1.7mph to 50 minutes at 3mph. My dad who I had tried to get on supplements and would never take them actually started taking one. I thought I lost him to brain fog. I thought I lost him to old age and that there was no hope. In the last couple of months I‚Äôve seen my 75 year old dad get his personality back.

Thomas K.,5.0 star rating,07/23/20, Love it! ," I get asked about it almost daily at the hospital and I promote it to everyone I know. Favorite feature is the promotion of gut health. The protective lining in our stomach is approximately half the size of a strand of hair, and we must do whatever it takes to protect it. Without that protection, we can develop ulcers or even leaky gut. Leaky gut ...Read MoreRead more about review stating Love it!is a relatively new concept in medicine and we are finding that makes us susceptible to cancers and degenerative diseases. So I highly recommend athletic greens for gut health. I also highly recommend eating fermented foods as that is the best probiotic for the gut.   I also like to recommend athletic greens because of the organic ingredients. That means no GMO's, herbicides, pesticides, or harmful chemicals. Organic is what our bodies need. Non-organic food is treated with glyphosate (Roundup) which is proven to break down the lining of the stomach (Bad for gut health). Glyphosate is then able to enter our bloodstream via the stomach and pass through the blood brain barrier. Very harmful to the body. So eat and drink organic.  Lastly, I love how athletic greens makes me feel. I live an active life; running daily, biking, and working in a hospital. I am able to do it all and keep going. I have more energy and I feel good in general. It is also great for recovery. I usually drink it in water, but will occasionally throw it in a smoothie or some orange juice.

That certainly changed when I was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive, stage 4 gallbladder and liver cancer In January of 2020. I suddenly felt terrible, then began heavy chemoth...Read MoreRead more about review stating RightIng a Sinking The Ship!erapy, felt worse, and my body weight plummeted to a low of 155 around mid March. For years I tinkered with various greens mixes, but all of them tasted terrible and were not worth the cost or time of having them. Besides, I took pride in taking no supplements or medications, getting everything my body would need through a healthy, well...fairly healthy diet. I never needed to lose weight, had a great health profile, and so didn‚Äôt think much more about any of that. Now I suspect that some of my micronutrients along with omega-3 fatty acids had been deficient for years.   Anyway, I began taking athletic greens in mid March 2020, in a bit of a desperate place. I was frail and felt terrible. The athletic greens tasted fine to my fickle chemotherapy tastes, and I would often alternate drinking this and high calorie protein shakes, each twice per day, when I was nauseous and couldn‚Äôt keep much normal food down. I started weight training again; short, basic movements with a small fraction of the loading that I would be able to handle prior to this diagnosis.   Somehow, I started coming out of it. The ship was at least heading in the right direction. Even DURING my ongoing heavy chemotherapy regimen, my blood profiles have been slowly improving, my CT scans have shown cancer regression (though I still have some digging out to do), my body weight is slowly climbing (currently a little over 170 lbs), and my strength is greatly improved.   It would be wrong for me to claim that AG treats or cures cancer. But I seriously suspect it as one of a few critical factors in my recovery thus far. I‚Äôm now actually optimistic regarding my short term prognosis, though it can be a grind. The mid-term is currently uncertain as chemotherapy is not a long term solution to my situation. The long term is still plain frightening. But I know that I will continue with AG, and it is well worth the cost and time to help me recover to the greatest extent possible.

It is extremely poorly designed. First the handle is very very VERY short. So you can‚Äôt leave it in the bag for convenience. If you do, it gets lost in there and unless you have extremely tiny hands you end up with fingers covered in green powder. Then the diameter of the scoop is just slightly smaller than the diameter of the athletic greens shaker cup.   The point is you can‚Äôt charge a premium price and afford the get the detail wrong. The product itself is good. But the bag, the scoop, and the cup, are all terrible, and worst they don‚Äôt work well together.   For $97 I shouldn‚Äôt have to put the product in a different bag (hard container in my case) and use a different scoop and cup, just so I can avoid getting the powder all over my hands and/or spilling it.

Mike S.,5.0 star rating,06/09/20, Amazing energy hit ," So, I'm definitely not a doctor or scientist, and this is only my anecdotal data, but I feel that I have to share my experience. I'm 59 years old, and had a full thyroidectomy a little more than 5 years ago. I am not an athlete, but I walk 5-7 miles/day, eat clean, and do resistance training every day. I have never been able to recapture the same ...Read MoreRead more about review stating Amazing energy hitenergy levels as I enjoyed pre-cancer. Perhaps 80-85% as a baseline. Before my cancer, my numbers were always good, as I follow a whole food, plant-based diet. In fact, the OR staff expressed amazement at them for a then 54-year old. Surgery went great, and after a year of dialing in the meds, the aforementioned energy levels seemed the best I could do. I long ago accepted this, counting my blessing that I'm still alive and generally feel pretty good.  Recently, my daughter -- a well-conditioned athlete -- gave me a travel pack of Athletic Greens to try. She is a huge advocate of the product. Stopped drinking coffee, eats less during the day, etc. I kid you not, but after drinking just a few sips, I could feel a tingling throughout my body -- like I had just taken a hit of something very pleasant and very illegal. My body just immediately responded. I finished the drink and just flew though the day, feeling great. I took it at around 7:00 am, and wasn't hungry until late afternoon. But more importantly, I feel more energy --real energy as opposed to a caffeine buzz -- all day. Until I went to bed. I was sharp and focused; I hadn't felt that way since before my surgery. I know use it every day, and never feel the need for breakfast (which probably pays for the AG subscription in itself). It's been a life-changer for me. I wish it didn't have Stevia, but I cannot deny the salutary effects it bestows. We're all different, with different body chemistries and nutritional profiles, but I have to recommend it highly. It's certainly a no-brainer worth trying if you know someone who can hook you up. If you have to pay for a single pouch, I know it's a lot, but you're covered by a 60-day guarantee. For me, there aren't enough stars to give it... Read LessRead less about review stating Amazing energy hit"

She outlined a topical remedy to try to address the lump, and I did that faithfully, the lump did shrink but never went away completely. If I forgot to do the remedy for a few days, it would start to grow again. We eat super healthy and live an active lifestyle, but it turns out I‚Äôve got a genetic mutation that prohibits my body from absorbing nutrients properly. She had prescribed the most bio-available supplements she could find.  Without making this a hugely long story, I want to sing the praises of Athletic Greens. I decided to take a chance and replace everything I was taking with Athletic Greens after comparing nutrient lists. Best decision I ever made! After one week my daily afternoon headaches disappeared. After a few weeks, my energy and clarity of mind were returning, after the second month some other hormonal imbalance symptoms straightened out. Last week I realized I had forgotten to do the topical remedy for that lump for like two weeks. I immediately reached up to check under my arm, thinking I was going to have to hit it really hard with that stuff after this long to get it to shrink again. The lump was COMPLETELY GONE!! I was astounded and SO happy!  You‚Äôve got a customer for life. I‚Äôve also recommended you to some friends and my husband. They are now all taking Athletic Greens and are reaping the benefits!

My energy levels have been steady without relying so much on stimulant foods that I would often crave. I still get cravings but the amount needed to keep me happy is about a third of the previous quantity necessary to satisfy any craving. This is a big accomplishment for a serial snack eater. I do and can eat just about anything with far fewer symptoms from gluten,alcohol, and sugar. Best of all, I don't feel anxious about eating food as a remedy for my stress. In addition, I also stopped taking all but one vitamin supplement which is the one for my knees and one for seasonal allergies to pollen. The cost savings has really helped offset the cost of the AG investment. Overall, I keep feeling stronger as time passes. I feel like this has been a good move overall and plan to continue taking AG to give myself all the help I can get as this 67 year old continues to play tennis and enjoy life. My wife is also on board and feeling great too. As we like to say may your best days always be ahead of you.

Eating healthy, having the right diet, and exercising regularly have always been a big part of my life. My training regimen now consists of running 90 to 100+ miles a week. When I heard about Athletic Greens, it spoke to everything I believe in and strive for - healthy lifestyle, natural living, and bettering your athletic performance. I have been taking Athletic Greens to start my mornings for a few months now and I can say it really has helped me feel better. I have more energy, don't feel as bloated or have as many digestion issues, and feel that I am getting my day off to a good start with my greens and essential vitamins. Adding this to my regular habits of eating healthy and exercising has only increased my athletic performance. I can't say it is all due to Athletic Greens, but I can say I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it! I even added the Athletic Greens protein powder to some of my recent orders and must say I am enjoying that too. I do not take any other vitamins or supplements, but coming home from my daily morning run and drinking my Athletic Greens or adding it to my morning smoothie makes me feel that I am getting all the nutrients I need to recover from my morning runs.
