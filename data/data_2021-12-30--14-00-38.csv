Dane C.,5.0 star rating,12/22/21," Transformative, honestly. Was skeptical at first, but I'm absolutely sold. "," As an athlete who is two months into an AG1 subscription, I thought AG1 would just be a simple and tasty way to get the right balance of nutrients and vitamins my body needs, but it's provided so much more than that. I'm feeling more energized, recovered, and ""regular"" than ever. Extremely happy with AG1 and will continue to subscribe and drink for the foreseeable future. "

Brandi F.,5.0 star rating,12/22/21, No better multivitamin out there ," As a follower and fan of the Huberman Lab, I tried athletic greens due to their high recommendation. I don't have a very big appetite and I'm concerned about getting enough nutrients on the daily. I was always trying to find the most well rounded multivitamin with quality ingredients. But as a relatively healthy person, I never really noticed a big difference with anything. However, I can honestly say with athletic greens, I do feel even better overall. Bonus that it tastes pleasant also. I absolutely recommend it. "

Alison A.,4.0 star rating,12/21/21, more energy + feeling good! ," love this and knowing i'm getting all my vitamins in one fell swoop. the only detractor is that even if you're on a subscription, they charge a shipping fee every month AND it takes over a week to get to you -- so if you're on even a 30 day supply, you will still run out by the time the new one comes. if you're going to charge almost $10 for shipping, it should get to you within 2-3 days max.

This is the first time I‚Äôve used a green powder consistently for a month and I enjoyed it, but I‚Äôm also checking out the competition, so I‚Äôm not sold. I think the ingredient list could still be improved(ex. wheatgrass to seaweed), but it has been enjoyable, and has a nice taste "
john B.,5.0 star rating,12/20/21, Love the product and notice difference in my body feeling better ," Once something becomes routine you can quickly forget how well it has worked.

HEATHER M.,4.0 star rating,12/20/21, Mostly satisfied ," I‚Äôve been using AG for a couple of months now. I like the feeling I get of starting each day off with a healthy drink. One good choice can lead to another, right? My only complaint is the sweetener that is added. I wish there was an unsweetened product to choose. The sweetener tastes like bubblegum which I really dislike. It can be mostly disguised by putting it in a smoothie but if you are drinking it with just water, the bubblegum taste is overwhelming. I have to chug the entire cup to avoid the taste. It doesn‚Äôt completely dissolve when shaken but that may be because I‚Äôm impatient and drink it without waiting. I‚Äôll continue to use it with the hope that there will be an alternative flavor choice at some point. "

Leah C.,3.0 star rating,12/18/21, Good but pricey , I really loved the idea of being able to get all my nutrients and a good bunch of greens in one scoop. I liked the flavor and that fact that it mixes so easily and isn‚Äôt gritty like some other greens on the market. I just can‚Äôt get past the price.

Andrew H.,3.0 star rating,12/18/21, Solid product but expensive , There are so many options on the market for really high-quality ingredients these days.

Lauren P.,5.0 star rating,12/15/21, Love it ," I look forward to drinking this in the morning in cold water. It‚Äôs refreshing. Although, I personally do not mind green tasting powders‚Äî this one is very mild and reminds me of a pineapple.

Shane D.,3.0 star rating,12/15/21," Nice product, bad taste, WAY out of my price range "," I really like the fact that AG1 put almost everything I need into one product. About the only thing I can think of that it doesn‚Äôt have is Slippery Elm Bark for improving digestion. But other than that, it has most of the digestive enzymes, probiotics, fiber, and vitamins I need. is not good. It tastes like wheatgrass or algae to me, and I struggle with it.

Don A.,4.0 star rating,12/15/21," Good, and expensive. ", I Really like this product. It‚Äôs convenient and it tastes good. Almost has a slight bubblegum taste but still has a greens after taste.

Colter M.,3.0 star rating,12/15/21, Expensive ," This product is expensive. If you are an elite or wealthy athlete this may very well be fine, but for anyone else the cost far outweighs the benefit. If you want to be healthy, spend $45 on a gym membership and put the other $43 towards buying more fruits and vegetables. If the cost were half as much I would consider it worthwhile. "
Jodi D.,3.0 star rating,12/14/21, Athletic Greens ," I don't find this green 'juice' all that much different from other, really. I've been drinking it for about 45days now and I don't see any drastic changes in, skin, digestion etc. So I probably will just go back to what I was drinking before because it costs less and with pretty much the same benefits.

My overall sense of well being has moved from a 5 to an 8 and my workout performance has moved from a 6 to a 9. I love not having to take a ridiculous amount of supplements in pill form. I just have my green juice in the am and get on with my day. I can't imagine life without it now.

I understand that you get what you pay for, but competition is huge and I may get a product with slightly less nutrients, but I can get twice as many servings. If AG was cheaper in Canada, I would subscribe to it. "

I'm so happy I did! I was looking for a full multivitamin that gave me the essentials, and this goes far and above. It tastes amazing (I don't have to choke it down), it's simple to incorporate into my morning routine (just add water and a scoop to a glass, mix, and drink!), and it has given me more energy. I highly recommend AG1 to anyone looking to supplement their already-mostly-healthy diet! "
Steve G.,1.0 star rating,12/08/21, Price ," I like the concept, and it tastes great. I have no problem with the product, it's the price. It's costs me about $100/ Month here in Canada.

Perry W.,3.0 star rating,12/08/21," Great brand and taste, bottle not that functional "," 3 full months into having Athletic Greens everyday, I'm enjoying the routine and the taste of the shake (simple to prepare with water). One issue is the bottle that came with my order is hard to clean because of how narrow it is, so it often has residue in it despite thorough hand washing in the sink. Also the powder mixture is prone to 'coughing' up some powder when a new bag is opened in my experience so far, potentially causing a bit of a mess and losing some out of a bag. Otherwise the only other drawback is the price being a little high. If you can budget for it, it's a great option to start your day. "

Darren E.,5.0 star rating,12/07/21, Part of my daily routine ," I've been doing AG for a couple months now, and have really enjoyed all the benefits it has to offer. I do intermittent fasting until noon each day, but have my AG (and some Vitamin D drops) at 11:30am to ensure that the first thing I put into my body (other than water and black coffee) is the most concentrated healthy thing I can do. It is SO much more convenient than having to mix up a veggie and fruit smoothie each day, because I don't have to buy the ingredients, prepare it and mix it each day, and so on. AG is fast, convenient, healthy, and doesn't taste terrible at all... in fact, I look forward to it, which is VERY unlike my experience with VEGA protein powder, because it made me gag literally every single time I had it... not joking, literally gagging. And the shipping of AG has blown me away, as I've never had ANYTHING ship so quickly and timely before! Not sure how you do it, but it needs to be recognized! "

Before, I used to take a menagerie of vitamin pills that always made me burp nasty vitamin tastes. Plus it seemed more like a chore to take my vitamins and I never knew if I was taking the right ones at the right time. AG1 takes the guess work out and it's more like a yummy cucumber melon treat first thing in the morning.

Keith S.,4.0 star rating,12/02/21, Great Product / Side Effects? ," I love Athletic Greens, I'm on my third month taking it. I used to make green juice every week but it became too time consuming, AG has been a good substitute. However, recently I'm beginning to think it's starting to give me an upset stomach/abdominal pain; I drink it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning and notice the pain. Has there been a recent change to the formula? I don't think I was experiencing this until recently. I did research saying it may pass, let's hope my gut flora adapts. Otherwise, I love your product.

It took me a few days to adjust to the taste, but it‚Äôs quite pleasant now.

Martin C.,5.0 star rating,11/30/21, It works!! ," I've been taking AG for about a year and a half and I have enjoyed it immensely. Before AG, I was stuck buying hard to swallow multi-vitamin/greens capsules and I just wasn't sure if they had all I needed. I hardly eat vegetables and fruits in proper amounts and I began to realize I needed a veggie/fruit mix in liquid form. I found AG and I love how easy it is to mix with water to get the proper amount of nutrients I need. Plus, the taste is terrific! "

Noticed a slow steady increase in energy throughout the day, faster recovery times, and general mental/physical well-being from morning to night regardless of workload. Only criticism I can say is that the scoops don‚Äôt fit in the bottles easily and I often spill some off the side. I‚Äôd recommend buying a small powder funnel for bottles to avoid the mess, or maybe AG could spent a few cents extra to provide one in startup kits. "

Charles Z.,4.0 star rating,11/29/21, Personal Review , Athletic Greens has positively benefited my health routine I for sure notice the difference in how i feel when regularly taking and then missing Athletic Greens in my dietary supplemental regiment.

Michele M.,1.0 star rating,11/29/21, Will not purchase again. , This product is too expensive and very difficult to get out of the pouch as it is so fine that you end up spilling a lot of product.

Tracey G.,3.0 star rating,11/22/21, I'm not as thrilled by this product as everyone one else. ," I have only been using this for about 2 weeks so I am probably not as qualified to pass judgement as some people on here but here are my thoughts so far: 1. It isn't as easy to stomach as many people report. It is grainy and doesn't fully absorb into the water and since it is such a fine, gritty, powder, it lodges in the back of my throat and makes me cough. I put a scoop in 8-10 ounces of cold water and drink it down as quickly as possible. I was hoping it would be more of a sipping through the day kind of drink but definitely not. 2. The taste although not awful, isn't awesome. I can really taste the stevia and I'm not a fan of that. It makes it rather unpleasant. 3. The benefits - I like to think it is making me healthier. I try to be as healthy as possible without overdoing things, I do enjoy living life, I'm very active, busy and don't love to spend lots of time cooking, so I'm hoping this is helping. I haven't noticed anything like more energy, better recovery, etc. I am hoping with more use I will see these results and if not, I am just hoping that it is helping my body in some way. 4. The price - wow, as a Canadian, this is a huge cost for me and without seeing much benefit and not enjoying the taste or experience of drinking it, I'm not sure how long I can sustain these monthly payments.

Both these things used to happen to me on longer, harder rides. I was also able to complete a week long solo bike trip. Even after being in the saddle for 5-6 hours, I‚Äôd wake up the next day ready to do it again. I definitely think AG1 made the difference between a suffer-fest and actually being able to enjoy it. Thank you! "

For me personally, I do many beneficial things for my body already and don't really notice ""any"" change. The taste is fine and I'm into things being sweet so when I make 24 or more ounces, I'll throw in a tablespoon of monk fruit sweetener. This is my first experience with a healthy green drink that's not loaded with sugar (like Naked or Odwalla after it was taken over by coke). I usually put it in 24oz or more of water in my thermoflask with ice and drink it while I'm sitting in the dry heat sauna. "

Josh H.,3.0 star rating,11/17/21, Waiting for shipment ," I have used your product for a while and ordered through Amazon. I had a subscription just like I do with you but with Amazon I always had my refill in time. When I switched to your company directly, I have been going over a week without having any daily servings. It takes a very long time for your product to arrive. I like the product but I may have to cancel my subscription and figure out a different way to receive it. "

Carrie B.,5.0 star rating,11/16/21, So far so good ," I have been taking the greens for just over one month. I like the process as the jar, scooper and bottle are easy to work with, clean and perfectly sized for the amount of the drink. I find that it gives me a little clarity in the mornings and allows me the half hour to do other things before I make my coffee and breakfast. That half hour goes by really fast! I like the fact that I shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about taking other vitamins - as a 50+ woman, it‚Äôs important to get all those nutrients. Plus, I am not great about eating as many vegetables as I should. Tim Ferriss‚Äôs podcast got me on to this as other products that I have enjoyed. It‚Äôs a little pricey but I think anything that can become a healthy habit is worth the price. "
Jasenka,5.0 star rating,11/16/21, The routine is what does it for me ," I used to buy these green powders from PCC all the time and never stuck with any of them for more than 1 week. There's something about AG that's hooked me - i'm the kind of person that loves gear and gadgets, and if I subscribe to something I'm probably going to try and get my moneys worth. AG subscription comes with a sweet green tin, scoop, and shaker bottle. Having the ""quick setup"" and dedicated equipment makes the routine much simpler and enjoyable - I always want to post IG stories of my morning routine but I'm pretty sure that would get old :D as for the actual ingredients, I'm not sure I notice that much of a difference in energy but I always had good energy - I am now down to 2 (from 4) cups of coffee each morning so that's something üòã "

For the last 35 years I‚Äôve had to have it as soon as I got up. I still love coffee but the need has very much diminished. I got a great energy boost when I started but that has tapered off. It seems a bit pricey but I am assuming that you get better absorption.

Dr. S.,5.0 star rating,11/15/21, World's Best Multivitamin , I was turned on to Athletic Greens after multiple fitness podcasts and writers including Ben Greenfield and Tim Ferris continued to consistently promote it. There is some advertising wive's tale that it takes seven times to see an advertisement before your mind considers buying the product. I must have seen (and heard) Athletic Greens advertised somewhere between 50-100 times before I clicked their Facebook promo ad which included a year's supply of Vitamin D (in an oil dropper format) and some included drinkware/container.

Alex M.,3.0 star rating,11/14/21, 1 Month in ," I don't feel any better or worse as far as I can tell after 1 month of the greens. It probably takes more time to feel it. Or maybe I'm just not that in tune with how my body feels. Likely some combination of both are at work here. Taste is fine, better than I expected given the color. r shaker. The opening is not much larger than the scoop, which makes it hard not to spill, or get the scoop wet on the sides. Also, the threads on the exterior of the shaker cause consistent dripping down my chest every time I drink out of it. Not big issues really, I can just use a different shaker. It just seems to me that they're wasting money by giving out the free shaker when it's not very practical or pleasant to use. "

I am amazed at how much better I feel when I take it. I feel more alert, and have more energy to get through my day. I miss it when I don‚Äôt take it! As a post-menopausal woman in her late forties, I struggle with brain fog and low energy and AG actually helps. Game changer. Thank you AG for delivering such a high quality product! "
Jordan S.,1.0 star rating,11/14/21, Shaker bottle are junk , For the monthly price you would think they would provide you with top of the line products.

I also have to admit that it has helped me kick my sugar habit, I LOVE CANDY, and now I don't even want it anymore.

Other than that I think athletic greens is a great product for health. "

Marian a.,2.0 star rating,11/01/21, Tastes Great but expensive ," While this tastes great, it‚Äôs expensive & honestly I have been using for a month & have felt no difference in my body. So it‚Äôs too expensive to buy just for the taste. "

Jason D.,4.0 star rating,10/30/21," Good, but doesn't dissolve smoothly "," These greens are full of great ingredients without any weird taste. The only downside is that it is hard to get the powder to dissolve smoothly. Even when very thoroughly mixed, there tends to be a thin green film around the outside and it is a little gritty at the bottom if you don't drink quickly or remix as you drink. I have no complaints and it's certainly not worth over processing or adding any chemicals to make the drink more smooth. "

Kenneth D.,5.0 star rating,10/28/21, Thank You ," I wanted to provide you some feedback of a different nature. I am an avid cyclist who suffered a serious crash over the summer that severely impaired my ability to eat, swallow, speak and so forth. As health/fitness was and is a lifestyle ...pre accident I took daily vitamins/supplements. Post accident my regular vitamin routine of swallowing pills small to ""horse size"" was no longer viable. Yet health and recovery were paramount. That is when I found Athletic Greens. I love the brand and of course have found in one serving a replacement for things I used to supplement and no longer could...and in an easily digested mix. Adding AG to my smoothies or simply with a glass of water first thing in the morning has become part of my new health regimen. Love the taste, convenience and quality. Thanks!! "

Carlos S.,5.0 star rating,10/20/21, Great start to any day ," Its nice to be able to quickly drink so much nutrients all at once. At first I thought it was too pricey, but after thinking about it I realized something. If I ate 1 salad a day it would probably cost 5 bucks and it wouldnt have all the Nutrients this product has. $5 times 30 days in a month equals $150. When I saw it like this I realized the value. 90 bucks seems like a lot but compare it to buying a quality salad daily at a restaurant or compare it to driving to grocery store a few times a month and then preparing it (washing, cutting etc). It would be nice it the price is lower but I wouldnt sacrifice quality to save a few bucks. "
Melissa O.,5.0 star rating,10/20/21, Great stuff ," I‚Äôve been using AG for almost two years now. I really felt a difference in my energy levels when I began taking it, and that has remained.

Laurie V.,3.0 star rating,10/06/21, Pricey but seems to be good quality ," I've been using AG for about a month now. I find it tastes alright in cold water and dissolves fairly well. I'm not sure if it's better than Greens+ or any other green supplement but it certainly does cost more, especially for Canadians. The exchange rate + shipping fees make it quite a luxury item so I'm not sure I'll continue to purchase it. Plus, I don't believe shipping a small bag of powdered greens to my house every month is great for the environment. "
Ryan L.,5.0 star rating,10/06/21, Jumpstart Your Morning , I really do love Athletic Greens. It is the perfect way to jumpstart your morning. The cost may seem high but it is worth every penny.  rise during a crazy time for us Houstonians.  
Fiona R.,5.0 star rating,10/06/21, Nicely surprised. Thank you. ," Am a 73 year young active person and I love life. I refuse to use the words ""getting older"", so I didn't like the fact that I was getting into the habit of taking a nap (or getting lazy!) early in the afternoon. So I started into my Athletic Greens and almost immediately I was aware that my energy level maintained itself throughout the day. I didn't NEED a rest, even though I could take one if I wanted to. I loved being back to my usual self. "

Karen T.,5.0 star rating,10/06/21, Life changing ," At 43, my body noticeably changed. The supplements that I had been taking for years no longer seemed to be optimal. I stumbled upon athletic greens while on vacay, they were left in my room by the hotel as part of a health and wellness offering, something to try that might help to improve your health and wellness. So, I put them in my suitcase and vowed to do the research before I ingested them. Fast forward, I have been taking Athletic greens for 2+ months every single day and have felt my body change. I have more energy, my skin looks better with a healthier glow, my stamina and recovery from workouts has improved vastly and my personal favorite; my gut and stomach health have improved tremendously, I no longer suffer from ‚Äúphantom‚Äù smells, my stomach is less bloated throughout the day and my bowls are regular. To say that this product has changed my life, is an under statement. Thank you Athletic greens. "

Benoit P.,4.0 star rating,10/05/21, I like it but please work on the taste ," Hi! I like Athletic Greens and it definitely helps my energy level and mood. But after 2 months, I still have a hard time getting over the taste (works better blended in a smoothie). I fail to understand why something so healthy has to taste so artificial. I would much prefer have a minty or lemony taste. Bubblegum might be better suited for a kid's product but as a grown up I would much more enjoy a more natural taste. Hopefully, we get more options in the near future. That being said, the benefits are worth the taste ;) "
Sarah C.,4.0 star rating,10/05/21," Really expensive, but one of the best products out there "," I cringe at the price tag every month, but then never end up cancelling my subscription because I haven't ben able to find another powder that comes close to the content and quality of this one. The taste is not bad, and it is just bursting with vitamins and nutrients that support my health. So for now, I will continue buying it, even though it really hurts to pay it. "

Nolan C.,3.0 star rating,10/04/21," Good product, good company. But the price... "," Good product. Mixes nicely, tastes good for greens and has everything you need to keep you going. But the price Is simply preposterous..... There are many products that can be purchased from locally owned businesses for an average of about half the cost and provide identical benefits. Will continue using athletic greens for now to hopefully see the magical benefits that are spoke about from using this product consistently but truthfully I don‚Äôt feel any different taking these greens than I do the others I have in the past.

I‚Äôve had digestive issues before and I think athletic greens has helped sort that out as my diet hasn‚Äôt changed too much and my digestive issues have lessened since consuming this product. I usually get the product within 7 days which I find impressive since it‚Äôs being dispatched from the USA and I‚Äôm in Australia. I had another delivery about 2 weeks ago.

Gregory H.,5.0 star rating,09/28/21, Experience with Athletic Greens after 2 months ," My daily diet is far from perfect so I decided to add a supplement like Athletic Greens to try fill in some of the gaps. My wife and i have been taking Athletic Greens first thing every morning for 2 months now, my wife has been happy with what seems to be an increases rate in hair and nail growth.

Lincoln M.,5.0 star rating,09/26/21, My life is better with Athletic Greens ," It's difficult to quantify the effects of nutritional changes on one's life. Some could be ""real"" physiological benefits; some could be placebo effect. What I can say is that I feel better, I sleep better, I have more energy, and my body often craves Athletic Greens at seemingly random intervals, even after I've already had it once in a day. The monthly subscription is a great value, and I keep a spare bag on hand to tide me over during postal delays and allow me to take an extra dose now and then. I feel much more confident that I'm getting what I need to keep my mind sharp and my body active. "
Leslie R.,5.0 star rating,09/25/21, Perfect for Travel , I never leave home without my AG....on trips it the first thing I drink before leaving my hotel room. I love knowing that I am following my most important routine even on the move. 
Michael P.,4.0 star rating,09/25/21, A+ expensive product , Good product with good taste. Initial product comes with a ceramic storage bowl and reusable shaker. Initial price is reasonable for these items. My only complaint is the product is expensive for a reoccurring subscrition basis. 30 day supply at a little over $3 a day + shipping and handling for $100 a month‚Ä¶yeah‚Ä¶no. I would revert back to other competitors such as 1st Form who have both vitamin & drink supplement for less cost. I would explore other brands before considering jumping back to Athletic Greens simply for the cost.

Susan W.,5.0 star rating,09/25/21, So grateful for this product! ," I have had a tremendous weightloss success in the past year loosing over 100lbs. The downside however was not getting the right vitamins and minerals to help sustain my health. I was feeling weak at times and suffering from leg cramps and other issues I wasn't prepared for (low blood pressure, hair loss, dizziness). My body needed time to acclamate. Since I started on the athletic greens I have increased my overall health and feel so much better. I don't have the low energy levels or leg cramps or dizziness and I feel like my body can now benefit from the well rounded nutrients, vitamins and minerals that I didn't have the knowledge I required during my health amendments.

And I recently had a week off from work and I was out of my routine so I stopped taking it ""unknowingly"". And I noticed I could feel a significant difference in my energy levels and my overall physical well-being. Felt sluggish and less coherent. It's a good product I would recommend it. Maybe a choice of flavors, after a while the flavor of it kind of just blends in and you don't really notice it anymore, sometimes it feels like a chore to drink it in the morning. So maybe some additional flavors or something to spice it up a little bit I'd recommend. Thank you "

Diane S.,5.0 star rating,09/17/21, Love the Greens but not the wait‚Ä¶ ," Athletic Greens is fantastic. Two things I think need a bit more explanation. First, I find using half a scoop after the first month is much better for me. Let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶the taste is not that inviting. Half a scoop in 8 oz of water goes down much better. The second glitch is the 30 minute wait after drinking. I do it but wonder if it really makes that much difference. What I think I might do in the future is add Athletic Greens to my morning protein Shake. This will help me get started fast on days I am short on time.  "
Jennifer J.,5.0 star rating,09/17/21, Great product ," I love this product. I've been taking AG for just over 2 months now every morning.

Brock H.,4.0 star rating,09/14/21, Great taste , I‚Äôve enjoyed using the product. Only 4 stars cause I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in my life since I started. I keep on it to get my greens in and hopefully it makes me more healthy.

Patricia C.,5.0 star rating,09/14/21, Love the product , Worth every penny. 
Elizabeth L.,5.0 star rating,09/14/21, There Is No Way.... ," .....that you would get all the benefits of Athletic Greens via your daily food intake, and even if you took supplements, you'd need to spend a lot of money (plus it would take up a lot of room in your cupboard). I took the time to read through, and write down, the benefits of each of the 75 ingredients and WOW....so impressive! Couple that with a yummy taste (I was expecting it to taste like swamp water lol) and I can sincerely say that I look forward to every morning and starting it with AG. I cannot recommend this product enough. My ONLY peeve is that, since I'm in Canada, unless I ask for my shipping to be changed in my subscription, I won't get my greens in time to take them back to back without interruption. Otherwise 10/10! "
Nicole G.,5.0 star rating,09/14/21, Amazing! , I cannot believe how much of a difference Athletic Greens has made in how I feel everyday! When I first received my greens I was afraid that it would taste horrible but to my surprise it wasn't disgusting. I admit that right off the bat I was inconsistent with drinking this and didn't notice much but since then I have been drinking my greens everyday for about two weeks and the change is amazing. Looking forward to how I feel in another month of two of consistently getting the nutrients that I need!

Mairead F.,5.0 star rating,09/14/21, Athletic Greens , Delicious and smooth. I was worried they were going to be sanely in texture or really astringent in taste but the opposite. I love that they are jammed packed with food for you ingredients. I‚Äôm hooked! 
Megan L.,2.0 star rating,09/14/21, Can‚Äôt get passed the taste ," I want to like this product. I‚Äôm sure it is beneficial, but the taste is terrible and super grainy that makes me gag. Probably much better in smoothies to hide the taste and texture, but I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. "

Trey H.,5.0 star rating,09/13/21, Surprisingly tasty ," Never expected what my kids referred to as ‚Äúbroccoli juice‚Äú to be something I enjoyed drinking every morning.

I‚Äôve been taking every day for the past two months and already noticed a big difference in my health. "
Elizabeth B.,5.0 star rating,09/13/21, Taken for over a DECADE! ," I know when something works when I run out of it and miss it in my daily routine. I have taken Athletic Greens for years, and feel great! When I first started using the product, I worried about the cost. Was it REALLY worth it? So, I tried other cheaper, less tasty brands. THAT was more of a waste of money than anything. I didn‚Äôt feel at my best. Swimming was more of a chore. My knees were more creaky. Seriously! I could feel the difference when I went back to taking Athletic Greens regularly. It also helps keep my weight in check. I just know when preventive maintenance works and I feel healthy and right. Athletic Greens keeps me at my optimum and is worth every penny. "
Stacy S.,3.0 star rating,09/13/21, Just OK , I like the flavor but don't have any real sense that AG is adding to my overall health. 
Deborah P.,5.0 star rating,09/11/21, I love it and I would have kept using it , It's just too pricey for me. $90 (this includes shipping) a month is far too big of a hit to my budget. Otherwise it's pretty amazing and tastes great too

My body craves it now! I went about a week between orders (after a month of taking it daily) and I could feel a difference in overall energy and feeling good. This doesn‚Äôt give me an energy ‚Äúboost‚Äù like a lot of products- I just feel more sustained energy throughout the day, cause I feel better. So, as long as I can afford it, it has become a staple. "
Lynn W.,5.0 star rating,09/09/21, Tastes Great , Love the taste even with water even greater in juice. Packed full of good stuff. We love it!! 
Eric W.,4.0 star rating,09/08/21, I feel great ," Overall, I highly recommend Athletic Greens. I feel better and for 30-days have even stopped taking extra supplements. I like the taste too (much better than others out on the market). The only downside, and why I'm giving 4 stars, is due to the price. I hope I can continue to use this product, but it's pricy. "

Meredith S.,5.0 star rating,09/08/21, Athletic greens for non-athletic mom ," I saw AG on social media, read the ingredients, and thought why not give it a try. If it tastes good and makes my body feel good, I could give up the numerous supplements I was taking. A customer service rep sent me 5 travel packets for free to try the product before committing. First off, it is green but doesn‚Äôt taste like liquid salad; it has a hint of sweetness which I love. I make this everyone morning with water while getting the kiddos ready for school. After my morning walk I refill my AG bottle with ice water and go about my day. Without being graphic, I have no constipation, it gives me the energy boost needed so coffee is optional, and my head feels clear rather than foggy. I am a subscriber to AG and look forward to the long term benefits. "
Frances P.,5.0 star rating,09/08/21, Great Greens ," So Tim Feriss recommends them and I thought I'd try them hesitantly because of the price. A couple of mornings later, I could not stand the thought of not being able to drink them every morning! I'm 45 turning 80 and my body has decided to go downhill. I put it down to having been born a preemie. But drinking Athletic Greens every morning has been a game changer for me. I just feel better, lighter, more solid than I usually do when I don't drink them. Especially through the pandemic and the stress and the illness, AG has helped me cope and gets me ready for the day. I plan to keep on drinking for as long as I can! "

Charlie K.,4.0 star rating,09/08/21, Good product , I found this product overall really good! It is easy to mix and drink. The ONLY downside is the price!

Richard L.,3.0 star rating,09/08/21, After taste , I have tried other green juices and they all have their own dominating flavor. Athletic greens use pineapple.

I could tell a difference with digestion and the prebiotics. My only issue is the cost. I‚Äôm living on that teacher salary so trying it was a splurge, and I like it a lot, but $92 a month with shipping is expensive. "
Derek M.,3.0 star rating,09/08/21, Seems to be excellent , Product tastes pretty good. Largely I feel like I have had more sustained energy and mental clarity. I would probably relate it higher if it was cheaper. For a monthly cost the price is quite high.

I drink a full scoop with ice water at 5:45 am every day. My energy level is terrific. I need that because my job is highly strenuous from 6:30 - 7:30 AM. My digestive system has never worked so efficiently. I fell fantastic all day long. I love Athletic Greens so much, I've taken a second dose before I hit the gym in the evening.

Mandy B.,5.0 star rating,09/05/21, Athletic Greens , My daughter-in-law raved about Athletic Greens so I finally decided to try them. Two an half weeks after I had my first drink I realize I had more stamina and my brain fog was gone. It took me a couple of days to analyze what I was doing different then I realized it was about three weeks earlier when I added the Athletic Greens to my morning routine. My 83 year old mother is here this weekend so I am going to have her trying them and if she will give it a month I have an extra bag for her to take home. She is working 7 days a week running her own furniture store and she loves it but her memory has slipped this past year. She is one smart lady and I know Athletic Greens will give her the boost she needs. Thank you!!!

He is finishing his first month of Athletic Greens and has received not only second subscription but bought some travel packs for upcoming trips. He has never consistently stuck to a supplement routine but AG makes it so easy! He is faithful every morning in drinking his AG first thing - usually one to rush out the door in the past he now takes his time, drinks his greens walking around outside. What a great meditative practice! He has noticed better digestive health, as well as, morning energy benefits and better sleep. AG not only has been great for his deep cellular health but overall mind-body wellness. "

The other brand drastically changed their recipe and I could feel the difference. I looked over the ingredients and reviews of every green drink I could find and kept coming back to Athletic Greens. I'm sure glad I did! It has so many of the things in it I was looking for plus a whole lot more. It's the first thing I have in the morning to get my day started. Also a big plus, of the other green drinks I've had, this by far tastes the best. I used to have to mix them with juice but I just use water for my Athletic Greens and it tastes good for a green drink. :) "

Tara D.,5.0 star rating,08/22/21, No Nausea-Tastes Good , Let me start with - my husband listens to Joe Rogan and has developed our healthy vitamin regimen. I get nauseous every day. So another Joe-pisode brought up athletic greens. We split a pack with a friend and I found I could tolerate it on an empty stomach and no nausea. I also noticed since I‚Äôm drinking a big glass of water vitamins every morning it suppresses my appetite a bit too and I even lost a few pounds. The cost is the only negative I can find and I get it. Vitamins are expensive and new technologies are expensive. But this works for me so we are keeping it up for me and he gets to keep the pills. 
Harsh P.,5.0 star rating,08/21/21," Great packaging, great product, awesome idea! "," I really enjoy drinking this first thing in the morning and it's now part of my daily routine.

Samuel B.,4.0 star rating,07/31/21, Perfect‚Ä¶. Except ," Athletic greens are truely amazing. The flavor takes a week or so to get used to. All the reviews that suggest mixing half apple juice and half water are 100% correct, this is the best way to drink them. It‚Äôs still not something you look forward to drinking but it‚Äôs very much NOT a chore. The flavor profile is not earthy like you would expect. You can taste papaya and citrus. After a month of use I could notice physical changes with my body and for the better. It may disrupt your belly for a few days as you get use to it. ( Constipation )  "

Chelsea B.,4.0 star rating,07/24/21, Expensive but great! ," I love Athletic Greens and drink it every morning either with water or in my breakfast smoothie. I‚Äôve been able to stop buying multiple vitamin supplements and simply drink Athletic Greens instead. The only downside is the price point. A monthly subscription price of around $90 with shipping is a bit steep for this broke athlete. Although it‚Äôs difficult to find a company and product that matches the high standards and nutritional content that Athletic Greens offers, there are good companies out there that offer a similar product at a more affordable price which I‚Äôve contemplated switching to. If you have the money to spend on a quality product, Athletic Greens is the way to go. If you are on a budget it might be harder to justify the cost. "

A lot of the unpleasant side effects of IBS have been minimized when before they were distractions at best and crippling at worst. I would recommend this to others with digestive issues! I'll admit that for the first week I found the taste absolutely terrible because I have always hated stevia but powered through because I knew it was good for me and my partner who also started taking it thought it was delicious so I figured it might be like how some people hate cilantro. I drank it daily and within about a week it started tasting really good to me. I drink it with 8oz of water and ice. If you don't like it at first please keep trying!!

Evan J.,4.0 star rating,07/16/21, Pretty good! ," So I tried Athletic Greens on a whim to help better my health. So far I feel like I do feel a little better, hard to tell what it‚Äôs actually doing to my body but it‚Äôs a positive. I wish they could work on the flavor some i get that chalky taste like you do with proteins. The price point in my opinion is pretty expensive but if they say it does what they say it will do then I can agree with the price. Only other negative is the cup amount for the 12 ounces of water it leaves behind some residue, not a big deal but for being almost $100 a bag how much money is getting left in the shaker? As a whole, I‚Äôd recommend it to people that want to make sure they are getting their daily supplements! "
Eric P.,4.0 star rating,07/16/21," Great product, high price. "," Love your product and the knowledge that I get my daily nutritional value in one simple form each day.

Brian K.,2.0 star rating,07/16/21," Over priced and super slow shipping, good supplement "," This is a good product however it is ridiculously high cost, and the shipping is also super high, so for that reason they should offer two days shipping, the company would be 10 times more successful because I‚Äôll be canceling specifically because of the shipping cost and how long it takes to get to my home.

I was very skeptical to say the least due to my previous supplement history, but I have been taking these greens for nearly 3 weeks now and my bloating has gone down significantly and I've had minimal gas cramps.

Ben S.,3.0 star rating,07/16/21, Good product expensive price ," comparing price, taste and ingredients, there are other products out there that compete at a lower price point. all I can hope is that athletic greens uses better ingredients and has a cleaner better manufacturing process.

If anything, I have experienced no ill effects what so ever. 3) Athletic Greens tastes good, and actually helps me start my day without the mid morning hunger or crash that comes from alternative means (meal supplement, or protein shakes, which leave me unfulfilled within 2 hours.). 4) I feel mentally alert and prepared, and this is truly due to Athletic Greens. 5) I get a much more restful nights sleep because of my much better nutritional foods that I choose to eat. 6) And when I eat well, take my Athletic Greens and exceed the energy and calories intake with exercise I lose on average about 2-3lbs per week.

Anyway, I love the product and drink it every morning. Tastes way better cold than lukewarm. I also got my wife hooked on it. She also noticed the boost in mental clarity. A bit pricey and I wish the packaging was better. It's difficult to get all the powder out when you get towards the bottom, and it always get some on my hands when I reach down. Really wish it came in a box instead of a pouch or some other type of container that is easier to get powder out of. "

I drink my greens, then I swish the bottle with another 8 oz. It's a good ritual for me (I love standardization of my route in the morning!) and I do feel more awake and ready to go. I still follow up with a cup of coffee - I still love the warmth of a morning cuppa - but it has changed my ""stumble into the kitchen and fill up the mug"" to: drink some exciting greens and feel energized!

However, I wish there was an option to purchase the product without Stevia, as I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners. I was also disappointed to receive notice that the 20-day travel pack subscription is being discontinued. Finally, although this is relatively minor, the lid to the ceramic container doesn‚Äôt fit (and a search through the Facebook group shows that this is a common issue).

Josh D.,5.0 star rating,07/14/21, Subscription Delivery Info ," I think some information when you sign up for the subscription on how long it takes to get your greens after the order is placed would be helpful. I got the travel packs which i used this month so i pushed by renewal back a week. However, i'm now seeing that 3 days after my order was placed, my green still have not shipped which means i will have to go a couple days without any greens. A breakdown of how long it take once ordered would have been helpful. Everything has been great so far! "
Heidi R.,4.0 star rating,07/14/21, Taste ," I know to keep it clean, the taste may have to be sacrificed, but that is my only negative really. I haven't been taking them long enough to see a difference just yet but feel good during workouts so I am going with it!! "

William H.,3.0 star rating,07/14/21, Great Taste ," The taste is far superior to any other greens powder I've tried, and the nutritional profile is very good. I can't say that I've noticed any difference in health or energy since I get pretty good nutrition without it. The high cost makes it difficult to continue buying every month. "

I‚Äôm happy with the product and I think this will remain part of my daily routine moving forward. I really enjoy the taste, which I found surprising. I don‚Äôt like the taste of most vitamin drinks and green juices, but AG found a way to keep the flavors subtle, crisp and refreshing without being bitter.  "

Kristen H.,4.0 star rating,07/13/21, So good! ," We LOVE these, my husband and I both drink these every morning and we genuinely feel good after!

Matt L.,2.0 star rating,07/13/21, Unimpressive , Eh I tool these over a month. I noticed very little nutritional improvement. I did notice it stifled hunger better than my usual supplement but not $100 a bag better. 
Cristina A.,5.0 star rating,07/13/21, So yummy! , Athletic Greens is so refreshing! I love that it doesn't taste too much like typical green drink mixes. I love the taste and I like to add creamer sometimes! Weird but delicious! 
Amanda W.,5.0 star rating,07/13/21, Remarkably tasty , I‚Äôve been enjoying Athletic Greens for a month now. I expected it to a challenge to drink each morning but it‚Äôs remarkably smooth and tastes really good - not overly earthy. If taste or texture is holding you back - don‚Äôt let it. 
Monica H.,4.0 star rating,07/13/21," Good product, hefty shipping cost "," Love the product, but believe the shipping cost is excessive. Many other supplement providers offer free shipping with purchase amounts less than $77. Eats up my $ savings. I doubt that it really costs $9 to ship that bag. "

Nicole R.,4.0 star rating,07/12/21, Needs a fiber boost , Would give this 5 stars for flavor and dissolvability/texture! The only thing I would like to see is a high quality better dissolving fiber added so you can still get a good fiber dose with it. 
Kaarin S.,5.0 star rating,07/12/21, Great Greens , I use these everyday and they make a huge difference in my mood and energy levels. I highly recommend them! 
Kate E.,4.0 star rating,07/12/21, Really like the product ," I really like the athletic greens, and the ceramic container is great, but my only complaint is that is kicks up green dust SUPER easily. You inhale it every time you make it. Maybe if there was a way to modify the container so there's less pressure when it's opened to make less of a plume of powder. "

Jessica C.,4.0 star rating,07/12/21, Love Everything but the Price and Taste ," For the first time in my life, I'm not sore mere hours after my workout, and I don't spend the next day hobbling around swearing that I'll never lift another weight. With this and other benefits, I can get over the grainy texture and alfalfa-like taste.  Greens may not always make the cut. "

Kerri C.,4.0 star rating,07/12/21, Athletic Greens , So happy with the changes I've felt mentally and logistically since taking Athletic Greens.. can definitely notice the difference if I miss a day. The only negative is the expensive price but whilst I can afford it I'll be sticking to them. 
Jason B.,5.0 star rating,07/12/21, Got Everything You Need + More ," Athletic Greens has really been more valuable than I ever imagined. Aside from the health benefits, which I can go on and on about - vitamins, minerals, probiotics etc. But the fact they make it so easy to turn it into a daily habit. I've started stacking other healthy things alongside this habit (working out, reading before bed, etc) and I've literally never felt better. "

Jeanne M.,1.0 star rating,07/11/21," Gritty, Gross, Barely Able to Drink ", I can‚Äôt stand the taste or texture of this superfood supplement drink. I went ahead and bought a different brand with a much more palatable flavor. 
Alex R.,3.0 star rating,07/11/21, Didn‚Äôt feel much of any improvement , I enjoyed the flavor of Athletic Greens and drank it consistently for the two months however it ends up being a bit too expensive. I didn‚Äôt feel as though I ever get any performance gains or improved gut health as claimed. Maybe I would‚Äôve had I continued but the cost of the subscription on top of all the taxes and shipping costs make it so it becomes unnecessary.

Ian B.,5.0 star rating,07/10/21, Best choice I could have made for my health ," I'm loving Athletic Greens. I've been using them for two months now and have definitely noticed a subtle difference in how I feel. I have more energy every day, and drinking them first thing in the morning has absolutely benefited my gut health. Also, if you happen to have one too many drinks the night before, they settle everything down in the morning. I'm also able to delay my first meal of the day because the greens provide so many nutrients I find I don't have to eat first thing in the morning anymore. It's also just really great to know that no matter what my diet happens to be on any given day, I'm at least getting a very powerful baseline of nutrients in my system consistently. I can't recommend them enough! "

Alex H.,2.0 star rating,07/10/21, Not great , Far too expensive. No significant difference in how I feel over taking a standard multivitamin. Taking as directed by mixing into cold water does not taste good. The water gets a gross foam on top and is unpleasantly gritty.

Teresa M.,5.0 star rating,07/10/21, A surge of energy , That is the most amazing part of greens no caffeine jitters because you need more energy these greens give it in a healthy way. My nails have never in 67 years grown so fast and looked so good! So many products claim delivery this is the first one I‚Äôve taken that truly is giving me results. My only complaint is I wish I had started them earlier! 
Scott M.,5.0 star rating,07/10/21, Great for summer and hangovers. , I work in the sun all day. Athletic greens are a great way to get some healthy stuff in your guts when you don‚Äôt feel like eating. You have to keep it cold tho. 
Marilyn H.,3.0 star rating,07/10/21, Too strong. ," I love that AthleticGreens is widely inclusive. I‚Äôve always reacted to supplements and been confused about which ones my body uses. AthleticGreens certainly has many ingredients that my body needs. To date, after about 4 weeks, I can tolerate 1/2 teaspoon daily. I‚Äôll be interested to see if this dose can increase over time. Or, will my GI start to reject even this low dose. Vertigo and unstable stance/walking are the main reaction I notice. Unsettling and disappointing. I remain hopeful that a happy balance can be found. "

Kent T.,3.0 star rating,07/10/21, Good not great , It‚Äôs really sad that I can‚Äôt get this product to a similar price as comparable products as there are many. The only thing separating is taste. The unbelievable social media hype is what really drives the demand for this product. While I do like this product I will easily jump when a competitor finally wises up and matches taste. In the meantime the owners and their supporters will rake in the cash.

I had been on medication for chronic constipation for several years and as a young 50 something year old energetic woman this was not great. Within 3 days of starting AG's I had stopped all medication and now apply a word to myself that I never thought I would ... I'm REGULAR. Other reviews cover energy, clarity, nutrition. But I wanted to add this to the mix. "

Jonah Z.,4.0 star rating,07/09/21, Great Nutrition But Bad Taste ," The nutrition in the Athletic Greens are beyond exceptional; however, the taste when using it alone with water or other milks isn't great.

Denisce C.,3.0 star rating,07/09/21, Seems ok but not great , It's been about 2 months since I started drinking athletic greens daily.

I'll try for another month and see how it goes.

Taylor T.,3.0 star rating,07/08/21, Really expensive and no results yet. ," So far they are fine. I have only been using them for a few weeks and have not felt any real differences. They taste fine, not great but some people suggest this takes at least a month or two for real results so I am going to keep trying it. Although these are way too expensive for no real results, it's kinda obscene how expensive this is given that it is supposed to help people. "

In this time I have noticed that my energy level during the day is better than it was before, even when I was taking supplements in the form of pills and gummies. I attribute this largely to the better absorption that Athletic Greens has. o considers vegetables and fruits to be a complete waste of stomach space better allocated to things I like to eat, Athletic Greens are a way to compensate for that.

Abby C.,5.0 star rating,07/08/21, Enjoying AG so far! ," I have been using AG for one month. The taste and texture have not bothered me at all, and I have not had any negative side effects.

Julie K.,5.0 star rating,07/08/21, Greens , These are hands down the best greens I have ever had. Taste is great! 
Michael C.,3.0 star rating,07/07/21, Good Supplement - Expensive , Been using AG's for 2 months now. Seems like a good nutritional supplement but it's expensive in bulk and the travel packs are even more expensive. I haven't noticed any benefit yet that would justify the expense. I'm giving it another month but will be looking for a less expensive alternative. It might help if AG had some kind of rewards program or didn't charge for shipping on top of the $77 per month for the product. 
Mc G.,5.0 star rating,07/07/21, Best tasting Greens I‚Äôve ever had! ," Athletic greens is the best greens powder I‚Äôve tried! My husband and I both love it and I‚Äôm so glad I got the liquid vitamin D3, K2 as well. "

Bracken M.,4.0 star rating,07/06/21, They are good ," I‚Äôve done two months of athletic greens and I have noticed a slight difference. I know I do not get enough vegetables in my diet so I believe this helps. Having everything all at once is a different story. Much like taking a multivitamin, the body will only absorb so much before it gets rid of the rest. This may or may not be the same as athletic greens. The one thing I enjoy the most is the amount of variety of fruits and vegetables it has in the powder. Most other products only has a fraction of the ingredients. "

Jackson G.,2.0 star rating,07/06/21, Overpriced ," I don‚Äôt mind the taste.

I could do without the fancy packaging, if the price leveled out to $1/day. Maybe a $1.25. As it stands, I‚Äôm willing to eat fermented foods, dark leafy greens, and other nutrient rich Whole Foods.

Justin K.,2.0 star rating,07/05/21, Delivered Hot ," So far, not super impressed. I've had two shipments delivered and both times the pouch was delivered in a flimsy USPS padded envelope, which allowed the pouch to get quite hot during transit.

I feel good taking something daily that's gives me a high quality dose of daily vitamins and minerals. The biggest downside is the cost and I don't have any data that my health has actually improved as a result of drinking it daily. I definitely feel great on a daily basis and believe that athletic greens is helping that (otherwise I wouldn't waste my time. Only problem I have is that it is rather expensive for me at $86 US dollars p/m.

It tastes horrible and mixing it with something else with flavor doesn't help. For the price I would think there would be a way to improve the taste and make the powder dissolve so you don't get clumps of wet powder.

My last shipment was earlier this month, but I probably won't consider renewing. "

Joshua G.,2.0 star rating,06/28/21, Overly sweet and pineapple-y ," I like the ingredients of these in the abstract, but I was walloped by the sweetness and overwhelming pineapple flavor of this mix when I used it in my overnight oats at the recommended strength. Admittedly, my oats recipe already had some fruit in it, but even when I omitted the fruit, the flavor of these greens was oppressive. I have since halved the recommended daily portion, and the results are tolerable, but not ideal. I will finish my supply, but am unlikely to purchase again. "

Marie W.,4.0 star rating,06/28/21, Still not a stevia fan ," Just completed my first 30 days drinking AG in the morning. There was definitely an adjustment period for my digestive system for the initial 10 days or so. Now that I am past that phase, and one month in, I still cannot stand the taste of the stevia. When I have purchased other protein or nutrition drinks I read the label carefully to make sure there isn‚Äôt stevia in it. The taste of AG is pretty good otherwise, though the last few sips contain quite a bit of grit which irritates my throat. I feel like my endurance has improved on the bike, my legs feel nicely energized but I have not experienced any miracles otherwise. I have always been very active, as a skier, cyclist, hiker, and a former runner, daily exercise is very important to me. I no longer compete; at age 69 I exercise only for fun! "

I obviously have to do more than just take AG in the morning but it really does make me feel healthier and gives me a healthy dose of energy in the morning. No need for multiple cups of coffee when I can have one scoop of Athletic Greens and am good to go!!

Leslie B.,5.0 star rating,06/22/21, 5 star quality ," I am really enjoying having this in my fridge. I am not a big supplement person and I am a stickler for quality ingredients so this is one product I actually don‚Äôt mind paying extra for. It is a very expensive supplement so I don‚Äôt buy it all of the time but during the Warner months and when I am more active, I have enjoyed adding it into my routine to help me stay hydrated and add some extra vitamins, polyphenols and antioxidants. "
Susanne T.,3.0 star rating,06/22/21," Great tasting, Lots of energy ", I LOVE the fresh flavor and feel more energized and healthier when drinking it. But it does not ever fully dissolve in water and you need to constantly shake the bottle. And it is just way to expensive. Not sustainable

I have not been pleased with the way they handle friend referrals, as they do not automatically credit your account. I have contacted them each time to ask about my rewards and have spent so much time trying to get them. This is disappointing and inconvenient.

This is a great way to fill the gap in your diet with all the healthy greens/supplements that you need. I recommend this to anyone looking to lead a healthier active lifestyle.

The amount of energy and the degree of alertness I had was just amazing. For twenty years I have struggled to keep my nutrition up and now I take two glasses a day of the Athletic Greens and I make it through the day. Maybe you should market this to gastrointestinal doctors!!

Carlos A.,4.0 star rating,06/08/21, I was skeptical ," I was skeptical especially at the price point. However, once i started to feel my gut function better and my energy and mood improve the cost i believe is fair. I never got the bundle i was promised hence the 4 stars "
Annie B.,5.0 star rating,06/08/21, Fabulous! , I have been using Athletic Greens for two months. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia and Athletic Greens has helped to reduce the pain and inflammation and given me more energy. I love them! 
Jordan M.,3.0 star rating,06/08/21, Too pricey ," I have loved adding this to my daily routine, but with such a hefty price tag I find the $9 monthly shipping fee excessive so I had to cancel. "
Jessica R.,5.0 star rating,06/08/21, The most comprehensive and complete supplement I've ever found ," This is THE most comprehensive supplement I've ever found! For years my vitamin shelf has been a hot mess as I've had sometimes up to 12 different bottles trying to get everything I need for my Hashimotos (and before that for pregnancy). Athletic greens has EVERYTHING and then some. All of the vitamins are in their most absorbable forms (hello methylated folate!!! And B12!!!). They also have some digestive enzymes, some probiotics, AND greens extracts like chlorella and spirulina AND adaptogens like ashwaganda and reishi.  "
Christopher D.,5.0 star rating,06/08/21, one slightly very annoying thing ," The packages are meant for 30 days of servings and then the subscription is once a month, so you'll end up missing a day or 2, its very annoying lol, have to buy 2 from the get go or figure it out and then be a month behind "
Abdulla A.,5.0 star rating,06/08/21, Must have for better life , I really noticed increased energy and freshness since I began using Athletic Greens. Will certainly continue using it. 
Dan C.,5.0 star rating,06/08/21, Great , You guys are amazing company. I have so much energy now. 
Kristen A.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, Great Product! ," Athletic Greens is the most well rounded supplement that I‚Äôve come across. I had been researching vitamins and probiotics for a while looking for the right products, when I came across AG which is an all in one. I think that AG is a reasonable price considering the amount of supplements you‚Äôre actually getting. There has been all kinds of improvements in my body that I had never gotten from other vitamins. Just after a month my hair has grown somewhere between 1 and 2 inches, I have a lot more energy, I feel cognitive improvements.. I love the product and I will continue buying it monthly. "
Mike,3.0 star rating,06/07/21, Dosage Effectiveness ," I love the idea behind Athletic Greens, there is no way I could eat the amount of fruit and vegetables needed to get all of the micronutrients contained in the product. That said I question whether the dosages are of any clinical effectiveness as there is very little transparency in the amounts of the ingredients contained in each complex. For example the ""Digestive Enzyme and Super Mushroom Complex"" list the quantity for the total amount of ingredients but doesn't include specifics per ingredient. The total amount of ingredients for the complex is 154mg but depending on the study, the clinically effective dose of reishi is 6 to 12 g extract daily. Ganopoly (a Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide extract) in doses up to 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks has been used in a few clinical trials.* The entire complex is no where near that dose and reishi specifically is the second to last ingredient listed so I can only assume there is barely a fraction of the effective dose. This leaves one to wonder how Athletic Greens determined the quantity of each ingredient to include, and was it based on any science regarding clinical effectiveness, or is it all marketing to just be able to say they include these really powerful ingredients regardless of effectiveness? I like to think I'm benefitting from Athletic Greens, but considering that I don't really feel any different when I take it, do I just need to double my dose, or considering the miniscule amounts of some of the ingredients would it not even matter and have I been sold on marketing hype alone? I'd love to see more transparency in the quantities of each ingredient as well as support for the dosages they included, otherwise for the nutrients they do quantify, I can get a comparable multivitamin for fraction of the cost. "
Spero M.,4.0 star rating,06/07/21, Great Overall , Love the taste and definitely feeling great from the nutrients. Only issue was the delay in getting the welcome kit with the ceramic container. It would be better if they could drive down the price a bit too. It's a very expensive vitamin but overall worth it. 
Katrina F.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, Great product , I purchased Athletic Greens to round out my diet and enhance my gym performance. I had no idea how nicely it would impact my skin! Acne has all but disappeared.

Roy W.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, I could tell a difference the first day! ," I was skeptical of purchasing Athletic Greens, not because I didn't think it would work but was it going to be worth the money? The first day I used Athletic Greens I could tell a difference in the way I felt, more energy, clear minded and surprisingly my stomach felt great. I didn't even realize that my stomach/gut were not feeling optimal until drinking Athletic Greens. I now drink it every day when I wake up on an empty stomach before working out! "
Carl B.,3.0 star rating,06/07/21, Trust me ," This is the second tome you‚Äôve asked me to review. As before, I just don‚Äôt know. How can I review something that has no physically perceptible signs or benefits? I am just beginning 2 weeks without the Greens after 2 months on. Maybe that will tell me something.  "
Megan E.,4.0 star rating,06/07/21," Love the greens, hate the bottles ", The greens product is great. Tastes better than most greens that I have tried. I notice that I feel better when I take it daily.  right or else it starts to leak out while you are shaking the bottle. 
Zach P.,3.0 star rating,06/07/21, Delivery delays ," Greens are great, just wish my delivery would arrive before the last bag runs out. 3 days now and no greens "
Jason J.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, Love it. Simply cost too , Love it. Simply cost too much. $9.00 for shipping with no slower option is difficult 
Ryan C.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, Noticeable ," At first I was skeptical about trying Athletic Greens due to the price. After a recent surgery that limited the amount and types of food I could have I decided to give it a try to keep myself from becoming nutrient deficient. The taste was different at first and I am not adverse to greens at all, but now I crave the taste every morning. I take it first thing in the morning and almost instantly feel an energy boost similar to a cup of coffee that lasts throughout the day. I feel better overall and a lot more focused. I still wish the price was a little better, but its something that I don't want to stop taking as there seems to be so many benefits. I'm one month in and definitely recommend it. "
Oxana G.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, Looooove it!!!!!! ," So far, the best supplement I've had. Tastes good, gives me energy and it seems I'm in a better mood when I take it ü§£ Highly recommend! "
Lisa S.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, Love my Athletic Greens ," I have to say I feel great drinking Athletic Greens. For one, they keep me regular and secondly, they benefit me during a workout when I haven't had a meal. The taste is really is pretty good. "
Carolyn S.,5.0 star rating,06/07/21, No More Brain Fog! ," I'm loving Athletic Greens...it has been so easy to make taking them first thing every day a habit, and after a month I already have better mental focus and more energy. "
Jayne O.,2.0 star rating,06/06/21, Haven't noticed any health benefit ," A friend gave me a sample of Athletic Greens and I tried it but didn't feel much difference so I thought I'd try it for a month. It's really expense. By the time you pay tax and shipping it's nearly $100 for a drinkable vitamins. While I can understand paying that price if it actually gave me more energy, nourished my skin and hair, or benefited my gut health but it didn't. Save your money. "

Pari K.,5.0 star rating,06/06/21, Surprisingly good ," I've tried other green drink powders before and I end up throwing them away they taste so bad. That's not the case with Athletic Greens. I was skeptical, but it really does taste good. It's an easy habit I've developed and a good way to start the day. "
Himilce L.,5.0 star rating,06/06/21, Greatness in one package , I stopped drinking all my supplements in pill form because this really has it all. Is convenient and it doesn't taste bad. I drink it every morning before breakfast and i have noticed changes in my performance when i run or bike.

Jessica J.,4.0 star rating,06/06/21," Great product, until the dregs "," I love the ease of ensuring that I‚Äôm getting sufficient nutrients every morning and it really tastes surprisingly good. Only minor gripe is that since I mix it in water (via vigorous shaking), I can‚Äôt ever get it to fully dissolve, so there are always some powdery dregs in the bottom. I‚Äôm sure it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if I was up for drinking it in a smoothie. "
Ajmal R.,5.0 star rating,06/06/21, Worth the investment in your health , Gave me an immediate boost of energy and help in recovery after lifting.

Christopher R.,5.0 star rating,06/06/21, Skeptic to Believer ," Skepticism and doubt ran through my mind when considering trying out Athletic Green; However, knowing my typical diet (white rice and a protein) and a generic multivitamin I knew that my body needed something more. So, after reading about and comparing this product to others of its kinds I decided to purchase and give it a shot. After receiving my first pack and trying it out I was relieved that it at least tasted good. Jump to day 3 and wow what a difference in my energy, focus, and overall mood. I was able to push myself more during my workouts both in cardio and lifting. I started feeling less fatigued through out my day despite my increase in workout intensity. And overall, my I felt good about my day and most importantly myself. I am in the middle of my second month and have no intention in stopping. I love Athletic Greens!! "

Antoinette S.,4.0 star rating,06/05/21, Well rounded and balanced , Been using AG for almost 2 months now. Don‚Äôt feel a significant difference but very happy with the idea of taking a well rounded and balanced supplement. I some times include in my shake. 
Suzanne A.,3.0 star rating,06/05/21, No Noticable Results ," I take thyroid meds in the AM, so having to watch the clock each day to time my AG drink after medication and before meals made watching the clock in retirement greater than any benefit of noticeable results. "
Brookes M.,1.0 star rating,06/05/21, Packaging and bottle is awful ," The greens themselves seem fine (apple juice really helps) but the bags, scoop and provided water bottle are truly a nightmare to use. Green stuff gets EVERYWHERE no matter how careful one is. That is the worst water bottle I‚Äôve ever used. It leaks so much. Sticking my hands into that pouch is so gross and my fingers get covered in green powder that then gets all over my kitchen. Please, please improve your packaging and bottle for a better user experience. I spent like $200 on this stuff for ONE MONTH and feel strongly it shouldn‚Äôt be this horrible to use. "

Caitlin H.,5.0 star rating,06/05/21, Beyond amazing. Love starting my , Beyond amazing. Love starting my day with athletic greens. They make me feel great and I no longer am suffering from tired slumps in the middle of the day. Taste great 
Levi A.,2.0 star rating,06/05/21, I love this product but , I love this product but I have had a bad experience overall so far. My first order was for the greens and container combo. It took much longer than expected for the order to ship and arrive and the container didn‚Äôt even show up. When I asked when the container would arrive the support staff said I needed to make another order and it would be shipped with that but I‚Äôve already paid for the container. I wish to continue purchasing and using athletic greens but only because I think it is a quality product. I have yet to receive my container by the way. Or my next order of greens even though I reactivated my subscription. 
Jesse S.,4.0 star rating,06/05/21, A great addition to my day but‚Ä¶ ," I love my Greens. They are a great way to start my day, and unlike most supplement drinks, the taste is actually really enjoyable! My only reason for a 4* instead of 5 is that the drink is a bit gritty, as all of the scoop doesn‚Äôt dissolve. This isn‚Äôt enough to make me stop by any means, I just wish I knew this going in! "
Donna L.,4.0 star rating,06/05/21, I enjoy the greens I ," I enjoy the greens I have them first thing in the morning, tastes good I add a little bit of orange juice. I feel my overall health has improved since taking the greens 3 weeks now "
Brandon S.,3.0 star rating,06/05/21," Great product, unnecessary shipping cost "," The powdered greens themselves are a 9/10, I‚Äôve been subscribed for a few months now and have only had a positive experience so far. This issue is the shipping. Yes, it‚Äôs enough to drop this by two stars because 9$ shipping is expensive enough as it is and yet, the timing is even worse. The shortest amount of time I‚Äôve waited for a shipment of greens to arrive has been 6 days. There have also been two separate occasions where the shipment was said to have arrived and did not get to me until the following buisness day. As a side note, I‚Äôm not including the processing time before the product is shipped, only the time from the initial email notification letting me know once the greens themselves have been shipped out to me. From the order date, the average time thus far is well over a weeks time, and for 9$ that seems entirely unrealistic. I‚Äôm sure they have an excuse for the delays, most likely the enduring yet overly relied on ‚Äúcovid delay‚Äù copy paste excuse that everyone uses but any normal person knows is no longer the case. For now, I can afford the shipping cost. But I‚Äôm sure there are many who cannot, and I myself am not a fan. If there was a legitimate reasoning behind this, like a private shipping partner, I‚Äôd understand. But this is being shipped through USPS and takes over a week to arrive from the purchase date, just an observation. Might want to let people in on the secret behind the cost, thanks. "
George D.,5.0 star rating,06/05/21, Athletic Greens Ultimate Daily Turbocharges My Morning ," Simple to prepare and tasty with a wide variety of breakfast fruit juices, my Athletic Greens supplement is my primary choice of nutritional supplement for feeling GREAT all day long.

I reached out to the company twice and although they were polite it was basically ‚Äúkeep paying us monthly if you ever want to receive what we should have sent to begin with‚Äù. For the amount I was paying monthly the service could have been much better and the response should have been‚Äù sorry we forgot to send you everything we will have that right out to you‚Äù. Instead I was told they would send the missing item in my next delivery. Didn‚Äôt come. I reached out again and got the same reply. I cancelled because basically they were never going to send it.

Kathrine M.,3.0 star rating,06/03/21, Unsure about value for money ," It was hard to tell if the price was worth it. I don't think Athletic Greens are ripping people off and making large greedy profits or anything, I just got the feeling that I could use that money on more organic produce to get extra nutrients and also fibre. I eat fairly healthy, so I did not notice any improvement in my energy or health. The taste was off-putting and I didn't like that there's stevia in it. Personally I'd rather have it with zero sweetness and then add it to a smoothie - in which case as may as well just take supplements and have a smoothie if I'm trying to up my nutrients. I don't know. My partner just ordered some and is going to do his own test. I also didn't receive the container that was meant to come with the starter pack.. there was a note to say they were out of stock and would send it at ta later date, it's been over a month since the order and it never came.

I am getting concerned that this might be a permanent condition, this dry cough that is worse after I eat or drink, irritating the back of my throat. I'm not sure what exactly in AG caused this for me, but it was something in there. Please stop sending emails wanting me to order your product again. That is NEVER going to happen. "

It is definitely the best tasting greens drink out there that has this amount of nutrients in it. I highly recommend it to anyone that is lazy like me and doesn‚Äôt meal prep like Bobby Flay.

Jon C.,5.0 star rating,06/01/21, NEW USER: 1 MONTH IN ," Love the concept & benefits of Athletic Greens; feels great to start my day knowing I have chugged all essential nutrients! I do wish the scoop had a smaller diameter & perhaps was deeper to accommodate the serving size so as to make it easier to pour into the 38mm mouth of my water bottle...The current scoop needs to be pinched to create a funnel effect for pouring into the water bottle. Inevitably, some of the Athletic Greens powder spills, leaving me wiping the placemat, licking my fingers like an 80s wild child, desperate not to waste even the dust of my favorite recreational, er, stimulant...I thought the travel pouches would be an easier pour but not really; have the AG Mktg & Ops team considered converting the travel pouches to a ""stick"" format? Totally dig the taste & the nutritional value of the AG, I'm all in! "

Tasveer B.,5.0 star rating,05/31/21, Amazing ," I am so pleased to have found the supplements that I have longed for. They fit my morning routine, my lifestyle in every way. I have recommended these to my friends & family and my best friend just ordered these right in front of me while I explained how I have been benefiting from them. I feel energized throughout the day and perform better. I am no athlete, just a working mother of two very young kids (5 and 2 years old) which is very demanding on its own. I have tried supplements in the form of pills etc. before but I was never good at taking them regularly. Having it to take it as liquid was so easy as for years the first thing I do in the morning after brushing my teeth is drinking a glass of water so now it has become drinking AG. I am so thankful to listening the Mindset Mentor podcast for Rob Dial Jr where I came across AG. I look forward for it to do wonders to my body, mind and spirit. "

Christine K.,5.0 star rating,05/30/21, Pleasant-tasting Energy booster ," Athletic Greens are easy to drink every day because they are pleasant-tasting. (Less-palatable greens products didn't get used.) I've been trying to cut back on coffee on and off for a long time, with no success. After drinking Athletic Greens daily for a week, I realized I had so much energy I was no longer looking for an energy boost from caffeine during the day and had drastically reduced coffee consumption without even trying.

Chris R.,5.0 star rating,05/29/21, Athletic Greens , I have been taking this for a couple of months now. I began taking to supplement things missing in my diet and for recovery after working out. I was surprised that it most helped some G.I. Issues I had been having. I guess that‚Äôs a bonus. 
Rae S.,4.0 star rating,05/29/21, Good taste and energy boost , Good taste and energy boost in the morning. Only small issue is not receiving my next shipment before I run out if greens. Usually only a day or two so not a huge deal. I prefer this to taking pill supplements! 
Ken D.,4.0 star rating,05/29/21," Great Product, Too Expensive "," I have enjoyed using this product daily for a month, but simply cannot afford to continue. I have found similar drink mixes at much lower prices from reputable companies. "
Elise N.,3.0 star rating,05/29/21, I wish it would dissolve better ," I like the idea of this and the taste isn't bad at all. I just hate the gritty stuff that's left in the last ounce each day.

Carlos G.,1.0 star rating,05/29/21, Over priced , Almost $100 first order came with extra things. Second order expected the same or Atleast the little jar. But nope nothing just the bag. So I pay the same price for less things? How does that make any since? No thank you.

Sierra R.,5.0 star rating,05/28/21, Customer service , Wonderful customer service. I had ordered the welcome kit but was unable to get all items in the kit. It was due to shortage of supply of the ceramic jars and shipping delays due to Covid19. I got a card along with what items were available in the welcome kit stating the shortage and that as soon as they came in they would remember to send me the completed welcome kit. With two months of new greens orders they would continue to email me saying they would send the ceramic jar when it was available. Awesome at keeping the lines of communication open! My third order of greens came this month and AG kept their word and sent the welcome kit with all items included! 
Luke A.,4.0 star rating,05/28/21, The only issue I have ," The only issue I have is with your bottle. It makes a mess everywhere. Don‚Äôt use those flimsy rubber seals in the cap. If it falls out, the entire contents will spill out. Even if the rubber seal is in place, every time I take the cap off, a couple ml‚Äôs of liquid falls out the cap and onto my seat, white cloths and so on. Don‚Äôt be cheap. You want people to advertise your product right? Well make a cap that makes people actually wanna use the bottle. Also juice gets underneath it and that becomes a manufacturing plant for bacteria. Think quality, because rubber cap seals are the furthest from it. "
Mary M.,3.0 star rating,05/28/21," Love it but just expensive, shipping is pricey too ", Love the item. Def feel more energy but it‚Äôs just so pricey. I don‚Äôt mind paying for it but wish it wasn't 9 dollars for shipping. 
Gina M.,4.0 star rating,05/28/21, Easy to drink , The flavor is not good or bad. It doesn‚Äôt have a strong flavor at all. I also like that when you get to the end it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre drinking all the powder. 
Tiffany S.,4.0 star rating,05/28/21," the greens are great, price is not. "," As much as I love athletic greens I have started shopping around for a similar product that is not so cost prohibitive. The price the greens is a lot to swallow, (pun intended) but then you add shipping and its almost $90 a month which is more than my budget allows. "
Chanel M.,1.0 star rating,05/28/21, Didn‚Äôt see it had stevia‚Äî yuck. , Was so excited about this‚Äî- unfortunately it‚Äôs Artificial tasting even with two big squeezes of fresh lemon.  
Anthony L.,4.0 star rating,05/28/21, Very Satisfied ," I have had trouble eating greasy and fried foods in the past, and I have a noticeably easier time when I take Athletic Greens in the morning. I also use the Vitamin D drops because I live in the Pacific Northwest and am lacking the vitamins from the sun. The taste is not that bad either, I compare the taste to Flinstone chewable vitamins.  The only drawbacks for me are that the powder clouds when I pour it out of the bags into a container, and the mix tends to sink to the bottom of the bottle as I drink it, so I often have to keep adding more water (Even after I shake it).

Emily,4.0 star rating,05/27/21, Great supplement - very expensive ," I just started my subscription and 3 days in, I feel like a totally different person. I don't think my gut health has ever been this good quite honestly. However, only downside is this is suuuper expensive greens powder for a 30 day supply. I can definitely say it's worth it, I just don't know how sustainable it is financially. I could maybe do 60/70 bucks but 100 with shipping is crazy. Shipping should be included for a subscription like this. "
Kim L.,5.0 star rating,05/27/21, 30 Days In and I Feel the Difference ," I've tried many green powder supplements over the years. There is without a doubt something different about Athletic Greens. I can feel the difference. I've increased my training, and I feel like I'm recovering faster. I also think my skin is looking healthier. No GI issues - in fact, this supplement seems to soothe my gut rather than agitate it. I have my partner hooked on them, and as a Licensed Acupuncturist and Integrative Medicine practitioner, I have told several of my patients about them as well. Would really like to carry them in my practice if at all possible. "

Paul L.,3.0 star rating,05/27/21," Great, but unconvinced it is better than locally sourced, much cheaper alternatives "," Athletic Greens is a great product, but I have concerns. It's inflated price point which approaches $1,200 CAD annually is concerning, but the vast shipping distances required to procure and distribute the product are a little tone-deaf in a world where local and climate care go hand-in-hand. I have been testing the product to see if it provides value above and beyond alternatives locally sourced, but I haven't found it as yet. It benefits from many major celebrity endorsements. I will continue testing in the interest of fairness, but I can't see an obvious benefit that makes it a stronger offering than $40 CAD/month alternatives. "
Cynthia N.,5.0 star rating,05/27/21, love the greens. , I really like the taste and look forward to breaking my fast with the greens every day. I do think the intro kit packaging is a bit much - the fancy box and all. I just need the greens in the packet.

I had to find this website and report on this product for the benefit of others. I was somewhat skeptical about the product which was advertised on a podcast (Joe Rogan) but decided to try one shipment. I have noticed an immediate overall improvement in mental acuity, significant uptick in daily energy and a faster recovery after exercising (walking, bicycle, swimming), The improvement is so noticeably significant I decided to report it to you the intrepid readers out there. I paid full price for the product, no freebie endorsement here. I recommend you make this your new morning coffee and I suspect if you are like me you will not regret it. Also note the drink dies not taste like grass which is what I anticipated, lol, it's actually surprisingly pleasant. I hope a few try this out and have the same results - I am paying it forward.

I feel great, it gives me an edge and it tastes good too. I like the ceramic container that they provide with the first order. It's definitely expensive and there are many other competing brands that sell for less, but Athletic Greens is established as a premium product for those looking for the best. The company really needs to figure out the shipping piece though. $9/mo to ship the refill bag is ridiculous. And 3 out of the 6 months I've been subscribed, the refill has arrived late. For $9 it should be next-day delivery however it usually takes at least a week to get to me. This month is already 3 days late. This frustration could be what causes me to end my subscription. "

Steve,3.0 star rating,05/21/21," Great Product, Terrible Shipping "," I really love the Athletic Greens product, I enjoy drinking it every day. I feel great, it gives me an edge and it tastes good too. I like the ceramic container that they provide with the first order. It's definitely expensive and there are many other competing brands that sell for less, but Athletic Greens is established as a premium product for those looking for the best. The company really needs to figure out the shipping piece though. $9/mo to ship the refill bag is ridiculous. And 3 out of the 6 months I've been subscribed, the refill has arrived late. For $9 it should be next-day delivery however it usually takes at least a week to get to me. This month is already 3 days late. This frustration could be what causes me to end my subscription. "

Outside of that the taste is good, the powder is a little messy.

Kevin B.,4.0 star rating,05/19/21, Athletic greens tastes very good ," Athletic greens tastes very good and is probably very nutritions, but is massively overpriced. I have also looked up some of the FAQs, including the one related to taking AG while intermittent fasting and I found the answers deeply unscientific. This has led to me AG is not developed with a strong scientific ethos and is, like the vast majority of food supplements, a product aimed at making money by pedaling pseudoscience to the gullible. I am a molecular biologist by profession, so this concerns me. I think that the product is probably decent, but I don't at all trust the business model, and therefore cannot ultimately trust the product. "

JANET K.,5.0 star rating,05/19/21, LOVE Athletic Greens! , I absolutely love these greens. I think the taste is great considering all the ingredients it has in it.

Josh H.,3.0 star rating,05/19/21, Athletic Greens Overall Review ," Customer service has been ridiculously great! Shipping has been terrible.

Currently I'm about 40 days in. I also understand that this is a lifestyle and not a medication. If the product truly contains everything it says it has in it, that's just about good enough for me considering I am unable to eat as many nutrients through food alone each day. "

Galen K.,5.0 star rating,05/18/21, Tastes great and I feel the difference ," Surprised how good this stuff tastes for how healthy it is! I prefer to drink with almond or oat milk over water, but it‚Äôs good either way honestly. I noticed a pretty immediate difference in my skin clearing up and having more glow, but also I just feel generally better since making this part of my morning routine. I wish it was a little less expensive, but honestly you get what you pay for, and this also replaces all the daily vitamins, biotin, etc. that I would buy too. Highly recommend! "

Haley B.,1.0 star rating,05/18/21, Tastes awful ," I knew better than to expect a nutritional supplement to taste delicious, but I could hardly even drink a glass of Athletic Greens. The taste is somehow both too sweet and too bitter. The texture is gritty and thick.

Lindley,4.0 star rating,05/16/21, Too Sweet for Me , I really loved the feeling I had after drinking my Athletic Greens in the morning after a workout. I did find the mix to be too sweet. I don't have a sweet tooth and rarely eat anything with sugar so I believe I may be a bit sensitive to the taste. I ended up combining the Athletic Greens with Turmeric and Pepper plus the juice of a lemon.

Although I'm a bit picky, the taste is a bit ""green"" tasting, so I've been adding citrus flavored joint supplement or Pre-workout powders. I'm still new at this, so trying different ways to enjoy this and make it my new ""go-to"" supplement! More later!! "

Mara R.,4.0 star rating,05/07/21, The Best Gut Supplement - 1 star off for taste ," I am lactose intolerant and have struggled with gut health and acne for as long as I can remember. I bought Athletic Greens originally to fill some gaps in my diet and was very skeptical of all the benefits they promised. However - it has cleared up my acne, taken the place of my usual probiotic supplement, and overall smoothed out my gut function. I also notice that my sugar cravings are down to basically zero. I started seeing changes after maybe 5 days. "

Tiffany N.,5.0 star rating,05/06/21, My morning isn't complete without my Athletic Greens! ," I have tried an insane amount of supplements, powders, mixes and juices over the past 10 years since becoming a vegetarian/vegan. I'm currently on my second month of taking Athletic Greens once a day (sometimes twice), and this is the only thing I use now. It has replaced my smoothie mix, magnesium powder, probiotic, and energy supplement! I get better results and feel better using this one product. I recently had a melanoma skin cancer removed from my leg and during surgery the doctor commented on how healthy my subcutaneous tissue was. He asked if I eat a lot of vegetables and specifically greens. I said yes I sure do! He said it has changed the color of my tissue to reflect the change, as the nutrients have been absorbed by my body. That's all I needed to hear to know this is really making a real change in my body. Thank you Athletic Greens! "
Ari S.,5.0 star rating,05/06/21, Great ," I was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I wanted a green powder that didn't taste swampy and included probiotics (this doesn't taste bad AT ALL and has a really smooth not grainy finish), this was a bit of a splurge for me but I had it 5 days a week excluding weekends so this lasted me a little over a month. I did notice a general sense of well being and my gut health DEFINITLEY improved (granted, I did reduce my coffee intake and cleaned my diet a bit). Having it first thing on an empty stomach really sets you up for a successful rest of the day because you are able to make healthier choices. But wow, I really felt the difference after I ran out. I have been without Athletic Greens for almost 3 weeks now and I can really see the difference! I feel groggy, my gut is in disarray and I have less energy :( I am ordering this again as soon as I can!!! "

I've noticed a considerable jump in my energy, focus, & a much better overall digestive system including bowel movements.

I teach early morning fitness classes and I am not naturally a morning person. My clients have been joking with me that I need to lay off the AG because my classes have been a lot tougher lately ;). I do notice a difference in how I'm feeling and though not what I was concerned about, also have noticed my hair is healthier and nails are stronger. The only reason I'm giving four stars is it's so expensive and I wish healthy food wasn't largely restricted to being a luxury for people at a certain income level. "

After doing my research and comparing the contents with other greens drinks + adaptogens, I decided to try it. First off, and everyone should know this. It's the only greens drink that actually tastes good. I've been buying greens powders for nearly 20 years and have thrown out more that I care to admit because they normally taste so terrible. Athletic greens tastes great! Even my kids (8 and 5 years old) will drink a shot just mixed with water. Next and most importantly, I feel amazing. My mood has improved substantially and this is considering that I live in Canada and am in our 3rd lockdown in a year. I also have more energy, and this has improved my home workouts. This is also the first review I've ever written for a product. It's great - worth the money. "

Job V.,5.0 star rating,04/29/21, love this product ," I originally thought it may be a bit expensive as I live in Australia and the subscription would cost about 100$ a month so I got the 1 off bag yo try it....after a week using it I was a convert and subscribed...consistent energy levels through the day, more regular bowl movement and just a general healthier feeling. One thing I was disappointed with was the lack of bottle with my first subscription supply,you get one with the one off purchase so I just assumed I would get another one with a subscription but was sadly disappointed. Apart from that it's a fantastic product and worth the $ if you can afford it "

It ensures that no matter how poor my diet for the day, I can meet my daily nutrient needs. I have felt consistently great with daily use.  It's a bit messy to dig for it! Once you have a scoop, keep it handy for subsequent bags! Also, I recommend getting a low height container to pour Athletic Greens into. The fine powder sticks to human skin, so limiting your ""scoop depth"" is in your best interest, believe me! "

Just starting my day off with the greens and with hydration sets me up for the day for other healthy choices. I do seem to have greater energy and maybe more importantly, there is the absence of tiredness through my day. It isn‚Äôt like I have high energy, it is just that I don‚Äôt feel tired all the time. I also really love the taste. The ceramic pot that was supposed to come with the first order hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I hear it‚Äôs on back order. I am looking forward to getting it so that I don‚Äôt have to deal with the package. Currently I am traveling and I am using the individual packets which makes it really easy as I don‚Äôt have to refrigerate it. I‚Äôm really happy that I made the choice to commit to this.

It took me a couple of weeks to notice a difference in my energy levels, but almost an immediately noticeable change in my gut health. Please note, they are low on welcome kits so you will not receive the whole kit when it arrives. Upon contacting CS twice, they said all we can do is wait meanwhile it feels like I waste a small amount of product at the end of the bag. Not a huge deal since I can use my own container, but definitely unexpected not to receive what was advertised. At $93 ish for the monthly bag, feels slightly steep, but again, its been helpful for me. "

Bethany J.,5.0 star rating,04/21/21, This product is QUALITY ," I have been using Athletic greens for one month. I have noticed a marked change in my energy and sleep. I have more sustained energy through the day, and I don't have sugar cravings in the afternoon AT ALL anymore! Also, I just had bloodwork done last week, and everything (including my thyroid) is normal! I usually have magnesium and iron showing up as low, as well as sometimes liver enzymes, cholesterol and thyroid (I am taking armour thyroid). I know that not all of this is related to Athletic Greens, but I am SURE that it is at least somewhat related! Also, I find the taste acceptable and it mixes very well. The only downside is the cost.... but I have decided that my health is worth it. If I didn't have two jobs (teacher and foodservice), I wouldn't be able to afford it, so I understand that it could be very difficult to to afford. "

Jackson M.,5.0 star rating,04/20/21, Simple and effective ," Wonderful stuff. I suffer from depression and anxiety and I was taking a cocktail of supplements and adaptogens to fight it without traditional medication, which I hated being on. I was spending a stupid amount of money buying everything separately. Athletic Greens really looked like it covered all the bases, so I took a leap of faith when it arrived and didn‚Äôt supplement with any of my usual stuff. After a full month I can say it was absolutely worth it. I‚Äôm saving money by having everything in one simple powder and I actually feel better than I was before - there are nutrients in here that I didn‚Äôt even know existed that have really made a difference. I take mine shaken with water and a little bit of Mio each morning during my workout. I have so much energy throughout the day now that I‚Äôve even been able to cut back on my caffeine intake! 10/10 would highly recommend. "

Tomas C.,4.0 star rating,04/18/21, I believe in it but pricey ," I like the product and the fact that it consists of so many vitamins, minerals and basically everything you need to start your day healthy. The only downside is the price. Compared to other greens powders I feel Athletic Greens is on the higher end. I wish it was a bit less expensive to make repetitive purchases more accessible. "
John P.,4.0 star rating,04/18/21, Great Product/High Cost ," I‚Äôve taken AG for a full month now and should be receiving my second bag shortly.

I take creatine daily and it‚Äôs common for me to experience bloating/digestive discomfort and felt a bit ‚Äútighter‚Äù after starting to take AG (For the record I drink roughly a gallon of water a day, sometimes a hair more and sometimes a hair less - This was part of my routine well before AG).

What I can say is that the company charges $9 to ship me an envelope which is approximately three times more than it needs to be. This is something I can quantify, and makes me question the ""higher calling"" the company likes to flash around in promos. I can't afford to take it daily during the covid layoff and my body hasn't seemed to notice any difference. "

I had been experiencing pain in my hips for a couple years. Not too bad, but enough to be uncomfortable. After about 3 weeks on Athletic Greens, I noticed that the pain was gone! It hasn‚Äôt come back. My wife, who is 48 and has an athletic build, had been taking Nexium for heartburn every day for at least 7-8 years. After a month on Athletic Greens, we decided to try getting her off of it. She stopped taking it, and it‚Äôs been a month now and she hasn‚Äôt had any heartburn! She also had been experiencing joint pain, and isn‚Äôt any more. We attribute all our better health to Athletic Greens. "

Mixing my Athletic Greens with almond milk or water is so much more convenient. The taste is actually good, not just tolerable. "

The flavor is among the best out there. My only complaint is the cost. By the time I ordered and paid for shipping it was nearly double what comparable super green powders sell for. If money is no object - buy AG. Unfortunately, after Covid it became so for me. Otherwise, I‚Äôd give it 5-stars and still be using it.  "

In today‚Äôs day and age of 2 day, next day, and in a lot of places same day shipping included in a membership price, 6 days to receive an order is just plain unacceptable. If Athletic Greens can speed up shipping, this review would be a 5 star! "

I love the taste and routine of having it every morning.

Charles N.,5.0 star rating,04/10/21, Helping To Keep Me Healthy ," I have been a school teacher for the last 5 years. The first 3 years of my career had me down and out with colds and other sicknesses 5-8 times a school year. I started Athletic Greens 2 years ago, and I have sick about 1-2 times per year. This was all pre-covid, but Athletic Greens definitely helps me feel more able to face illness and prevent disease. When I feel a cold sneaking up, I take a double dose for a couple of days and the illness usually fades away. Love this stuff!! "
Tracy S.,3.0 star rating,04/10/21, why does it taste so sweet? ," Over the years I have tried several brands of food-sourced ""green powders"", I don't notice the difference with any of them, nothing different about Athletic Greens in that regard. I like that the product aims to ensure there is a cross section of vitamins/minerals/enzymes just in case I am not getting enough in my diet. I am not sure why the company adds stevia and why they wanted a formula that is so sweet, based on the other ingredients the sweetness was a surprise. Just because stevia is natural doesn't mean it is good for you or even neutral - adding in this type of sweetener means the company is more concerned with getting a sweet taste than your health, would be curious to try this product without the added sweetener. "
Meagan,5.0 star rating,04/10/21, We love Athletic Greens! ," This has been such a lifesaver for my husband and I! We work hard to provide balanced diets and clean supplements for our daughters but were not taking great care of ourselves. After several months of terrible breakouts on my face and low, low energy in the afternoons/evenings, I knew that I needed to make a change. Since taking Athletic Greens, my skin is clearer, my gut health has improved, and the greens definitely gives me a zip of energy either as a coffee replacement in the morning or an afternoon pick me up on a rough day. And I actually really like the taste, especially when mixed with cold water right out of the fridge. This product is a little bit of a splurge for our family's budget so my husband and I share a bag and obviously do not take it every day. But a few times a week, I look forward to my Athletic Greens! (And for those questioning the price of this product, it would cost a small fortune to purchase EACH of the different supplements included in this powder INDIVIDUALLY! So to my husband and I, it is worth the price tag!) "

Nicholas B.,1.0 star rating,04/10/21, Cost , Although I am sure that you have an eloquent answer for this.. your stuff is expensive. It should get cheaper for long time customers.

My appetite has really decreased during quarantine, and because I live alone and don't cook/prepare fresh food that often, what I do eat isn't hitting every nutritional box. I'm seeing obvious digestive benefits, pretty tasty for this kind of product (actually gives me a reason to get up and go to the kitchen in the morning); mixes smoothly with waters but clumps up in almond and oat milk, which is annoying.

Chad N.,5.0 star rating,04/09/21, Amazing daily routine , I had an amazing multi-vitamin (formulated for am and pm) I was a big fan of. Once I learned about Athletic Greens and how the founder could have sold out to a large corp. and didn't because they would have changed the raw ingredients for better margins I made the switch. I love this product and hope they never sell out. It may not provide all the levels of supplement I was receiving from my multiple-vitamin but I feel taking AG in liquid form on an empty stomach helps my body absorb the vitamins and not purge valuable ingredients. Not to mention the additional benefit of the enzymes and probiotics not found in your traditional multi-vitamin. It is absolutely worth the price. My wife take this and are trying to figure out a way to budget it for our kids.

Mark,5.0 star rating,04/08/21, More energy for my kids... ," I feel compelled to write this. As a Father of young twin girls, a 'serious' amateur marathon runner with a demanding job within the Oil and Gas sector I was very dubious to try this product but new I needed to try something to fill holes in my flagging energy levels and diet. After 2 weeks of taking this product I noticed I can last longer into the evening, get to sleep with no issue (and stay asleep) and feel I have much more energy to spend with my kids when they need me most. Anyone who has trained properly for a marathon whether you are a 6 hour marathoner or an elite, knows how much energy this one sport takes from you. Athletic greens is a great partner to my existing diet and current lifestyle. "

Then many years later through a YouTuber I liked. Turns out both times the product didn't seem to have any effect upon me. I felt now better or no worse. I was hoping after all those years that maybe the formula had improved. So maybe it's just my chemical make-up. But for me it just didn't make me feel any different.

Noticed a significant improvement in digestion, which is the main reason I wanted to try (i have IBS). The greens seem to be helping me manage my condition and I've even noticed a little bit of weight loss and feeling slimmer around the waist. That being said, I am not noticing this big surge in energy that is a big part of the marketing of the product. I work construction for a living and physical labor is part of an everyday regimen for me and have noticed no change in my performance at or after work. Maybe I haven't been on the supplement long enough to notice the boost of energy, but that is why I gave only 4 stars. "

Dawn H.,4.0 star rating,04/03/21, Too much powder left at the bottom ," I enjoy the taste of Athletic Greens, but I am not able to use the full scoop because too much powder floats to the bottom and doesn't get dissolved no matter how long I shake this. I have been using half a scoop, but even that much does not fully dissolve. There is also a thick foamy head at the top that forms once the mixture is shaken, which traps little undissolved particles in it. I sometimes have to remove the foam with a spoon. It's not ideal. "

It is anywhere from $30-$60 more expensive than any of the others on the market and some achieve the same or better results. I buy this solely based on the flavor (which you guys nailed), but I am not sure I will continue for good. Organifi and Green Vibrance both have wonderful ingredients and are way more cost effective.

Jessica P.,5.0 star rating,04/02/21, Pleased but pricey , I really enjoyed the benefits and taste of the athletic greens. I had to cancel reoccurring shipments due to the price. The texture can seem grainy as the product settles. This was easy to combat with a shake of the athletic greens bottle and ensuring that there was adequate water. Wish this weren‚Äôt as expensive otherwise I would continue taking daily as I had. The care team was very responsive to a damaged package and provided a replacement.

Kate R.,4.0 star rating,04/01/21, Great product but messy , I love the product. I definitely feel more energized on the days I use it. The taste is ok but not fantastic. I do sometimes add it to a smoothie. The product is messy and dusty and the green powder gets everywhere very easily. I actually dropped the ceramic jar taking it out of the fridge one morning and cleaning that up was an awful experience. They have no replacement jars which I would have happily paid for since it was my fault it broke. I prefer storing it in the jar since it‚Äôs such a dusty product. They offered to send a replacement when they have one. I don‚Äôt plan to order anymore until I can get another jar.

Monica I.,4.0 star rating,03/30/21," Tastes great but ""chalky"" feeling in back of throat and can't take on empty stomach ", I like the taste but there is a chalky quality to it after swallowing - like the powder residue didn't fully dissolve and catches the back of my throat. I shake it as hard as I can in the bottle but it still doesn't fully dissolve. the same is true even if I put it it my Vitamix. I also can't take it on empty stomach. It made me nauseated one morning and I had to vomit. I have to take it with food 
Lisa R.,5.0 star rating,03/30/21, Best health decision ," I‚Äôve been using Athletic Greens for over a year now. I‚Äôm absolutely hooked.

Kelly E.,4.0 star rating,03/28/21," Great morning supplement, but issues with shipping "," I‚Äôve only been on the greens a month but I loved it! The only problem is I signed up for a recurring shipment and I‚Äôve been without the greens for a week tomorrow. I really wanted to see what the effects would be if taken daily, but it seems there‚Äôs an issue with recurring shipments arriving on time. Might check to see if they offer just buying a few bags at a time and storing up. "
Grace L.,5.0 star rating,03/28/21, Love this stuff! ," This is the best green drink I have ever tasted. I wanted the benefits of greens but just couldn't stomach them. Tim Ferris, an 'influencer' promoted these and I believed that he had done his homework -so I gave them a try. I actually look forward to starting my day with them! Previously, when I had greens, my stomach turned at the thought of them and I literally held my nose to get through them, only finishing them due to the expense and not wanting to waste them. As for what Athletic Greens cost, considering that I am not paying for other vitamin supplements, and I WANT to take it, it is well worth the value. Another boon for me is that didn't want to rely so much on coffee picking me up in the mornings, and this stuff gives me a great, but gentle, lift and buzz! Highly recommend! "

Sandy S.,4.0 star rating,03/28/21, Enjoying my Greens! ," I would give this 4 1/2 stars only because the flavor took a little getting used to. After using it a month, I have gotten used to it. I used this product for 1 month and then stopped for a month. I noticed the difference. AG helped with energy, bloating, recovery from workouts, and improved sleep. I prefer taking a multivitamin in a drink form because I use other ""pill"" form supplements. I definitely recommend AG. "
Kimberly P.,5.0 star rating,03/28/21, Nice whole food supplement ," I am enjoying athletic greens as a morning beverage knowing it's loaded with good vitamins and minerals for me. Nice to know it comes from whole food sources. It's hard to constantly eat well, but at least I know I've started off my day well if the rest of it goes down hill from there... "

William T.,5.0 star rating,03/28/21, Great Product ," I have been an Athletic Greens customer since the middle of 2020, and I have found it to be a great tasting and easy to use product that has taken the place of traditional pill supplements in my diet while proving to be overall better for my diet. At first, I was skeptical of it given my past experiences with green supplements and drinks that tend to taste horrible and leave an aftertaste thats worse then eating chalk, but athletic greens is different. It mixes well, tastes great, and the container and scoop that they send you really helps with keeping it fresh in the fridge. I also subscribe and get the vanilla protein powder, which has little sugar but still tastes better then some brands that are loaded with sugar. I tend to mix the green supplement with the protein powder in the morning and I find the combination is a great way to start the day. My only criticism is that the amount that they send in the green packet rarely lasts all month even with careful even spoon fulls and management, and the portion powder only lasts about 18 days, so I have found myself having to order extra canisters of the protein powder and the greens shake to fully make it last a month between subscription shipments. Overall, a great product that I would highly recommend, just be sure to watch how much your using if you want to make it last to the next shipment. "

And the great thing about it is, it tastes just fine, I enjoy it. Every morning when I wake up, I drink my athletic green, then a half an hour later I start my day with coffee breakfast and work, or play, just like when I forgot to take my athletic green omega-3 fish oil, I don't feel like I have the same pep when I don't take my athletic greens.

The shipping however is super slow. I understand that all shipments are slower these days, but the shipping speed is the slowest of any product I have ordered. If you order, allow at least 2 weeks before you get the product. You will also not get any estimated delivery date beside the information saying arriving on time...and then poof...arriving late. With no estimated date. So if you are on subscription service you will need to budget (use less than a full scoop) to allow for the delay in delivery. "

Tavie T.,5.0 star rating,03/17/21, I don't crave coffee anymore ," AG had an unexpected side effect. I don't crave coffee anymore! AG gives me sustained energy all day, and there is no more afternoon crash. I even quit coffee for a few days, but got headaches from caffeine withdrawals. I easily could have weaned myself off coffee/caffeine forever, but I love the taste of coffee so now I drink an 8 oz cup or less vs a 24 oz cup. AG tastes great, and it's easy to make. The only negative about AG is the expensive price. "

Amanda L.,5.0 star rating,03/10/21, great service ," great service... my daughter gifted me a month for xmas. I love it, but now the stevia aftertaste is getting harder and harder for me to handle. I just shake it up with water first thing in the morning, but I have to do something about the stevia. At first it was ok, but it seems to have gotten stronger (probably just my tastebuds rebelling ) "
Sam G.,3.0 star rating,03/10/21, Great first batch... but second? ," I loved AG‚Äôs through the first month, but my second batch seems to have a bitter, chalky taste to it.

I much prefer drinking AG than swallowing a bunch of pills. Overall I think AG helps with my energy. I also think it helps with my sleep, as so far I haven‚Äôt had any insomnia nights. I did have a lot of insomnia nights when taking all the vitamin pills and it included something for sleep. "

Jackie R.,4.0 star rating,03/10/21, Great taste , I didn‚Äôt notice night/day difference. Probably because we replaced a crap ton of vitamins with Athletic greens so we were already on the road to recovery. I do believe vitamin D is playing a major role in my mood. I usually suffer from depression and being extremely unmotivated. HOWEVER READ THE LABEL CAREFULLY. PEOPLE GET THE DOSE CONFUSED ALOT. YOU CAN OD ON VIT D. HAVE YOUR DR DRAW LABS AND TELL YOU HOW MANY DROPS TO TAKE. Tastes like pineapple. The last drink is very gritty as all the residual sifts to the bottom. I just rinse the cup and swallow it down. Overall it brings comfort knowing I‚Äôm putting good into my body. I would like to see Athletic Greens start putting the percent of daily value for each nutrient. Ya we are getting 75+ nutrients but how do we even know it‚Äôs beneficial if it‚Äôs not labeled with how much we are getting? People just look at the label and think it‚Äôs amazing to have that many varieties of nutrients but too nieve to think it‚Äôs probably not enough to make a difference.

Diane H.,4.0 star rating,03/08/21, Great Product ," Have been using this product since November 2020. Has definitely improved my energy and well being, so much so that if I don't drink it for a couple days I notice a huge difference in energy. I have tried other green drinks and this one is definitely the best tasting one. Initially it was an acquired taste but now I look forward to drinking it. I would give this a five star plus if they did not contain the Stevia as I find it leaves a slightly weird taste, more so in the Protein Powder. Because of that I would not buy the protein powder again as I find it too sweet with an unpleasant aftertaste. I think the greens would be even more exceptional without Stevia. I offered a sample of the greens to a friend of mine, who because of the Stevia developed a headache after drinking it. I was hoping she would benefit from them as much as I have. Just my two cents. "

I noticed a boost in energy and just general sense of starting my day off right ever since I started drinking it every morning.

Gillon M.,3.0 star rating,03/07/21, They‚Äôre fine , Shipping is slow and they‚Äôre a little expensive in comparison to others on the market. Tastes okay. Nothing you‚Äôll look forward to but it wont keep you away either. Remains to be seen over time what health benefit there might be. 
Sarah P.,4.0 star rating,03/07/21, Tastes great! ," The flavor is really good, kind of pineapple coconut.

Chad G.,5.0 star rating,03/06/21, A product that truly works! ," I began using Athletic Greens nearly 3 years ago . I haven't kept a continual use which has actually helped me realize the true effectiveness of the product. ncluded driving through the contiguous 48 states, i realized I needed to change something so that I would be more mentally aware and less fatigued. Along with an Intermittent Fast Diet I introduced Athletic Greens into my daily diet. Results for me were nearly immediate. After the first week I noticed a shift in mentality and more regular energy. My mind seemed sharper and more focused. Having the greens first thing in the morning also cut out cravings which was a huge benefit to the diet and within a month I had dropped a significant amount of weight! "

Malia T.,5.0 star rating,03/06/21, Lives up to the hype! ," So my husband and I finally decided to try Athletic Greens after hearing about it advertised by different podcasters for a few years now. We always try to get enough greens and vegetables in our diet but never eat quite as many as we mean to. So here‚Äôs how it went for us. Just a couple days after starting it, we immediately noticed an increase in energy. Then only a few days later we noticed improved digestion. It‚Äôs been just over a month and we feel so much better than before!! The energy levels have stayed up, we don‚Äôt have nearly as many stomach issues as we used to, and for the first time in my life I have nice fingernails. They used to always break off and chip if I ever tried to grow them even a millimeter past my fingertips but now they feel much stronger and more durable than before. My mom actually said it looks like I got a French manicure but of course I didn‚Äôt. My hair is also getting smoother and easier to manage, which seems kind of impossible after just a month, but I‚Äôm happy to say it‚Äôs true. The greens don‚Äôt taste as great as orange juice or something, but considering everything that‚Äôs in the greens powder, it tastes as good as you could hope. Absolutely loving the greens and though it‚Äôs kind of expensive you couldn‚Äôt get me to stop taking it because it has really changed my life. "

It seems to take over 1 week to get the order and we end up missing a day or two before it comes in. And that is with being aware of the situation. Overall we will still continue to use AG "

The benefits are tangible in that I have not been sick with a virus since starting taking 'greens' first thing in the morning - well before any coffee or breakfast to let the prebiotics work. I also add D3 and believe this assists in the results that I have experienced. Other members of my family now green up and deplete my supply meaning I have to advance my autoship dates all the time !

Welcome pack with shaker and storage jar was a very nice touch - kudos! After all that, I love being on this mix, I feel great, and no more coffee cravings. I‚Äôm actually saving money each month from not buying coffee, more so than the cost of AG, so for that reason along it‚Äôs a winner! "

Owen C.,4.0 star rating,03/03/21," Very good supplement, some issues not related to quality "," I was recommended to try athletic greens by a friend of mine and I'm 90% very happy with it. My first very small issue is that there is just a little bit of grittiness if I don't stir it enough at the start. The second is that, because it uses so many greens, there is a slight bitterness (that I solve with a sugar-free flavoring/sweetener). The third, more substantial issue, is that the ceramic container that comes with is very heavy and completely smooth, and every time I take it out of the fridge I'm worried that I'll drop it and it will shatter. Other than those things, I'm very happy with the product! "
Peter C.,2.0 star rating,03/03/21, Not Sure , I took Athletic Greens every morning for 8 weeks and did not notice any differences. I workout at least 4 days a week and do various sports along with a fairly healthy diet. I gave it two stars because it didn't taste as bad as I thought would.

I don't eat a lot of vegetables, and ever since I started athletic greens, I have a normal sleep schedule for the first time in years, I'm no longer tired during the day, and I have energy to actually go back to work again. The taste isn't fantastic, and the texture makes it a little hard to take down, but it's way better than trying to eat vegetables.  "

Randall E.,5.0 star rating,02/27/21, Superb Customer Service ," Just received my 3rd month‚Äôs pouch of AG. At 68, I am probably not the typical AG subscriber. And though I have never lacked energy, am in relatively good physical shape and get plenty of regular exercise, I continue to feel good & strong, and know that I am getting a group of vitamins and minerals without taking a handful of pills. I have to believe that body absorption of the vitamins is more efficient when taken in this fashion. Although, I am perplexed why AG put additional D3 and K2 in a liquid supplement bottle. Maybe it‚Äôs a science or pharmacology answer. I had a couple of start-up issues with receipt of product and promo items, however the AG customer support reps whom I chatted with were incredibly helpful, knowledgable and followed through on promises. I could not have asked for more. "

I don't mind the taste, it smells SO good! It's a little gritty, but that does not bother me. I can drink it on an empty stomach and it only makes me feel AWESOME. No tummy upset whatsoever! Cheers!

Eric H.,4.0 star rating,02/22/21, Good product ," Athletic Greens is definitely the most comprehensive health and wellness supplement out there. It‚Äôs expensive but considering it‚Äôs composition, it‚Äôs justifiable. I do agree that it‚Äôs a viable health insurance policy. I think that the general population would be considerably healthier if we all supplemented with the likes of athletic greens. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs too much skepticism about the positive effects of supplementation but I‚Äôm convinced that anyone who takes athletic greens for a week will notice a difference in how they feel on a daily basis and that should be enough to convince anyone of its efficacy.

Hfoxx,5.0 star rating,02/19/21, I really wanted to hate this ," After seeing how much Athletic Greens would cost me each month, I really wanted to hate it. I figured I'd try it for a month and then move on to the next product that would leave me disappointed and wanting more. To my surprise, I really liked it. The taste is pleasant but still tastes healthy. After a month, I decided it was fine but I wasn't willing to pay that much each month for something that I could probably get somewhere else for cheaper. I cancelled my subscription and didn't think about it again until 2 days later. I felt horrible. I felt tired and just plan blah. I went over the past few days in my mind and realized that the only thing I had changed was that I had stopped taking Athletic Greens. I immediately got back online and started my subscription again. After telling my husband about my experience, he decided to give it a try too. We love it. It isn't cheap each month but it is definitely worth it. We just look at it like a meal replacement. Thank you Athletic Greens for providing a product that does what it says it will do. This hasn't happened to us in a long time. "

Carrie J.,5.0 star rating,02/13/21, Exceptional Product and Results! ," I started back using Athletic Greens from when I had originally started way back in 2015! (at that time, $$ was tight, so I just wasn't committed to spending the high$ anymore, until now!) My son turned me back on to AG after sharing the wonderful results he was experiencing! He learned about it from a podcast. Well, that said enough for me because I know my son, having raised him myself and he has ultimately suffered, what many do everyday, with depression, fatigue, no motivation among other negative feelings and so....wow, this did if for him! He started a new job back in September 2020 during a time the Pandemic was still at a scary place for us all, a front line worker that needed a boost in order to survive this new challenge in his life! It has pushed him to such a better place, that I'm taking this time to share it! As for me, being back on AG for the past month does remind me of the first taste I had encountered way back in 2015. It's probably the best GREENS taste of many brands I have tried to date. Has a bit of a cocoa flavor so it helps to mask the tremendous response you may encounter as you try drinking potent greens nutrition for the first time. Relieved to have come back to this after noticing the remarkable response that my son embraced while taking AG himself. I had made a one-time purchase last month, sparing the $20 savings incase I was not gaining anything positive from using this again, and so now I will subscribe. Being a 50yo woman going through that sh** we all encounter around this age makes it difficult at times to stick to all the good things in life, mainly nutrition! So, just in this last month of downing the AG with10ozs of water every morning upon waking up, has given me the motivation to feel that nutrition is the most important thing any of us can gain for a better quality life, so I will be connecting my soul to AG ongoing and skip all those other supplements I've been taking for the past few years, even my multi-vitamin can take a place back on the store shelf, AG seems to have it all and some! I feel fantastic considering the sh** 50yo women go through during this time, so thank you to Athletic Greens! "

Sam H.,5.0 star rating,02/13/21, Better tasting ," Green juice and liquid multivitamins, while healthy, definitely have a bad rap for their unpleasant taste.

Laura S.,4.0 star rating,01/15/21, Good product that could be great! ," I like the idea of getting so many needed vitamins and minerals first thing in the am. I often don't get enough greens throughout the day through my regular nutrition. I don't typically drink my greens before I work out except for Saturdays before my personal training session. Maybe it's all in my head but I feel like I have a little more energy if I drink my greens versus if I don't. As many have said in reviews I've read, the taste is an acquired one. It has a flavor that reminds me of bubble gum but an earthy bubble gum. As long as my water is extremely cold, the taste does not bother me. The one thing that keeps Athletic Greens from being excellent is that they don't fully dissolve. No matter how much water I use, how much I shake it up, or how long I let the greens sit and then re-shake them, there's always a fair amount of grit at the bottom. I have to clench my teeth and use them as a strainer and then chew up the grit. Otherwise, it causes me to cough and sometimes gag. "

I am a competitive runner, 98 percent vegan, working mom of two young kids and we recently got a puppy. Sleep isnt easy to find around here and I have found that AG provides me energy, is gentle on the stomach and helps me to get the nutrients I need to fuel my lifestyle. The taste is actually OK and I find it works best first thing in the morning before my coffee and morning run. Highly recommend this product as an essential part of an active lifestyle. "
Lara P.,5.0 star rating,01/11/21, Lives up to its reputation , There are so many endorsements for supplements so it can be confusing trying to navigate the most optimal.

Peter M.,5.0 star rating,01/07/21," Great Product, less coffee? "," I‚Äôve been taking Athletic greens for a few months now. Great flavor and really easy on an empty stomach. I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt crave as much coffee in the mornings. I still drink coffee, as I enjoy the taste, but it‚Äôs interesting that I don‚Äôt crave it as much! The container that holds the greens that each starter kit comes with, is really great quality. And although the shaker is plastic (I think glass would be a better touch), I think the whole kit and product itself are a win. It does come at a high cost, but if you can stomach the price, Athletic Greens is worth it to me. "

Edwin P.,4.0 star rating,01/02/21, Athletic Greens Review ," Hello - I have been using Athletic Greens for a few months now and i am very much satisfied with the product. At first I was skeptical about it but I am sure that it has helped my overall health. I don't have any to show improvement, but I like my energy levels and my blood pressure has gone down a little bit.   about the product, the only thing I would say is that since the product itself is a little bit on the high end as far as price, you should consider absorbing the shipping charges in order to make it more affordable for people. I order a lot of things online and most companies include free shipping when you spend more than 75 dollars (regardless of the weight). To be honest, I am considering looking for other alternatives because of this. I am sure i am probably not the only one who is a bit tight financially, and can share the same feelings. Anyways, i hope this helps... "
Donna V.,5.0 star rating,01/02/21, Best New Discovery ," I feel so much better after taking Athletic Greens for 30 days. I can‚Äôt imagine going back to not having it. I feel more focused, energetic, and balanced. I have fewer cravings for unhealthy food as well. Go Athletic Greens! "
David S.,5.0 star rating,01/02/21, Do Not Want To Live Without ," Starting around October 2019 to this review today on January 1, 2021, I believe I have the experience to write an honest review of my opinion of Athletic Greens. Prior to my subscription I was what one might refer to as a ""Cold Magnet"". I'd average four to six Colds per year, each one lasting around four weeks with ten to twelve symptoms from sore throat to sinus triggers to lack of energy to stuffed up and of course miserable each time. I'd supplemented with D3 to some help, but everything else I'd tried over some 30 years was essentially worthless and a waste of hard earned money. I began consuming Athletic Greens about 14 months ago and while I do believe I've contracted Viruses during these last 14 months, I have exhibited almost no cold symptoms. Keep in mind that a large portion of this time frame happened during the Pandemic, in New York City (Manhattan), and as an ""Essential Worker"" I spent five days each week walking to and from work, and interacting with a great many people. I believe without a shadow of a doubt that Athletic Greens daily consumption has kept me healthy and feeling good. I currently have a 15 Day subscription and I do not like to live without it. "

My overall experience has been overwhelmingly positive. I have integrated Athletic Greens into my daily routine and recommend them to all my friends and family. - Thanks, Joe "

After the first few days I started noticing I was drinking less coffee and didn't get tired around 2pm (which always seemed normal) I found myself having energy without jitters or anxiety and helping me into a good morning routine. I would say though (maybe I'm not mixing it enough or something) but there's often powder that doesn't mix all the way through so finishing the drink isn't always fun and it takes a couple shakes to make those last few sips but other than that I love this product and will definitely buy another bag once I have the funds to do so!

On the negative side, whereas I thought that my metabolism might speed up and enable weight loss, I have been gaining weight steadily. Admitedly, I have been eating more sugar and sweets than I should, but even so. I don't love drinking the stuff, so there is very little incentive for me to continue after I finish what I have. "

Hannah M.,5.0 star rating,12/11/20, The best ," I've been using Athletic Greens for about 6 months now, and there is no other product that compares! To try to have a complete supplement that is vegan, kosher, organic, etc. and delivers all of the right stuff your body needs first thing in the morning is TOUGH- on top of that, finding a product that doesn't taste horrible or make you feel sick on an empty stomach is practically impossible. Athletic greens does ALL of that. Plus, I usually suffer from horrid sinus attacks in the morning and I haven't had a single one since I started taking these greens. Overall, my health and wellness has been remarkably better since I started consuming these. "

Using Athletic Greens daily has helped me with reducing (and typically, removing) these symptoms completely; while I don't think Athletic Greens is the sole reason for this, adding it to a routine rich in collagen smoothies, reduced carb intake and a more active lifestyle have all been integral to the improvement.

Stacey P.,4.0 star rating,11/25/20, I love the product but the shipping takes way too long , I love the product And would get five starsbut the shipping takes way too long. I have been out of the greens for a week now and I still not received my next shipment - still showing days away from receiving. For as expensive as this product is I would think the shipping should be a little bit quicker.

Jessica L.,4.0 star rating,11/23/20," Great Product, Good Results "," I've been taking Athletic Greens for over a month now and it's become routine for me. I take it on an empty stomach in the morning and I'm excited to say I've noticed increased energy! It's great to know that no matter what, I'm getting a daily dose of greens, even on days where I may lack them in my meals. Overall, great product. Because it is an expensive monthly subscription, I plan on tapering down to receiving my greens once every two months, and use it when needed. "

Derek P.,4.0 star rating,11/22/20, Love the product but... , The product is amazing. It really makes a difference in my day to day. Sadly though if I use the ceramic scooper I am usually a two to three days short on supply. Also shipping has been hit and miss for a large portion of the year. I understand C19 has really messed everything up but I've missed 10 to 15 days worth of greens so far this year. I started ordering two bags just so I would have extra for just in case. I'll keep ordering and I love the product though.

My only complaint is that while on the subscription every 30 days, I always run out 3-4 days before my next shipment arrives. I thought the bag was supposed to last 30 days and it‚Äôs happened twice now that I‚Äôve run out, but other than that I love my greens!! "

Vanessa D.,5.0 star rating,11/20/20, I‚Äôve been taking athletic greens ," I‚Äôve been taking athletic greens for a month now and these are the things I noticed. When I take AG on an empty stomach, it kinda makes my stomach feel a little unsettled but it only lasts for a few minutes. It could also be because I drink it like a shot of tequila because I don‚Äôt enjoy the taste too much but I did notice that my waist line was looking smaller or maybe the right word is deflated since I started taking AG. I would assume it has something to do with the gut bacteria. The taste was difficult to get past at first but I somehow felt like I recognized the taste and then I suddenly I realized it tastes exactly like a marijuana edible, the green flavor, and after I realized that the taste always gives me a big smile hah. That is all that I have actually noticed or attributed directly towards taking the all in one supplement but in my mind it‚Äôs one of those things that you see over a long period of time by giving your body the nutrients it needs everyday to maintain a healthy body. I will continue to take AG as long as I can afford to or until I figure out how to get all of the nutrients I need from diet alone. "
Gary,5.0 star rating,11/20/20, Fabulous customer service , I‚Äôd like to thank Latifa for a great service. An order wasn‚Äôt going to get to me on time so it was forwarded to where I was working.

Michael J.,4.0 star rating,11/20/20, AG cleared my morning brain , AG cleared my morning brain fog within 2 weeks. Before AG it took me 1 to 1.5 hrs in the mornings to feel fully awake. After AG 5 to 10 minutes and occasionally as soon as I open my eyes! Gut health/bowl movements are much more efficient and I will leave it at that lol. My only complaints are I didn't receive my vitamin d and late delivery this month.

David A.,5.0 star rating,11/19/20, Outta sight ," The initial taste was something to get use to but the benefits I was feeling-greater energy and better digestion put the taste concern on the back burner. Now I‚Äôm about 2.5 months into use of the product and I don‚Äôt miss a day. I enjoy this in the morning and am trying to find ways to sneak it into my more aqueous beverages, water, tea maybe cold coffee. The taste is now refreshing and the energetic surge I experienced initially has now become a steady state of comfortably high energy. Expensive, yes. Good, yes. Metabolic satisfaction and energy, very good. Product value, very high. "
Kate H.,5.0 star rating,11/18/20, Excellent Product. ," This is a fantastic product. I have tried dozen of supplements touting more energy and various other marketing promises, and this is the only one that has ever done exactly what it says. I have been using it for about 3 months now and I can say I noticed a difference within the first month and it hasn‚Äôt wavered. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I have tired days after longer workouts or less sleep but i no longer have a profound afternoon exhaustion that I previously suffered from. I take it every morning as my first consumption and I plan on continuing! Awesome product you guys, thank you! "

Side note: try with coconut water - it is a winner! "

The only thing we didn‚Äôt like was that it comes in a bag, as the lower it gets, the harder it is to scoop from the bag. This month we were finally going to invest in a new storage option. But to our surprise we were gifted with a storage container in this month‚Äôs shipment. We were so thrilled and thankful, since we had just been talking about it. Honestly, it‚Äôs the little things that make us so happy with a company, and that went above and beyond our expectations. Thank you for the generous gift! "
